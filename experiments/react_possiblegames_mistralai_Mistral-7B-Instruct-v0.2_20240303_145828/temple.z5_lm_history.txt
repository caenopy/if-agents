You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends.

Thought 1: I will start the interactive fiction game by taking the initial action.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.

Release 2 / Serial number 021118 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/2
Standard interpreter 1.0

Void
You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner.

Thought 2: I will check my inventory to see if I have any useful items to help me navigate this strange world.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Check inventory]

Observation 2: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 3: I will explore my surroundings to see if I can find any objects or clues that may help me.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine void]

Observation 3: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 4: I will try to move in a direction to explore further and possibly find something of interest.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation 4:
You move, or rather you come to a new place. The concept of body and movement seems different here.

Void
This new location is not much different from the one you came from. The shadows are still moving around at random through the abyss, reverberating with strange sounds and coloured light.

A cascade of red colour explodes below you.

Thought 5: I will investigate the source of the red color that just appeared below me.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[Go down]

Observation 5:
Void
This new location is not much different from the one you came from. The shadows are still moving around at random through the abyss, reverberating with strange sounds and coloured light.

Suddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long.

Thought 6: I will try to move away from the frightening shape to avoid being overwhelmed by fear.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation 6:
In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.

The shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.

Roof
The city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star-filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down.

Thought 7: I will explore the roof area to see if there are any clues or objects that may help me understand my current location or progress in the game.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine roof]

Observation 7: Judging from the masonry the tower must be centuries old. It towers high above the nightmarish city below.

Thought 8: I will check the inventory again to see if I have found any useful items since my last inventory check.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[Check inventory]

Observation 8: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 9: I will continue exploring the roof area to see if there are any clues or objects that may help me understand my current location or progress in the game.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine railing]

Observation 9: The most spectacular thing about the railing is the small statues decorating it. The artist must have used his most morbid fantasies for inspiration when carving these monsters, yet they are realistic to minute detail.

Thought 10: I will examine the statues on the railing more closely to see if they hold any hidden meaning or clues.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine statue]

Observation 10: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 11: I will continue exploring the roof area, checking each statue for any hidden clues or details that may be important.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine statue 1]

Observation 11: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 12: I will examine the other statues on the railing one by one to see if any of them hold hidden clues or details that may be important.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine statue 2]

Observation 12: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 13: I will continue examining the statues on the railing to see if any of them hold hidden clues or details that may be important.

Action 13: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine statue 3]

Observation 13: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 14: I will examine the remaining statues on the railing to see if any of them hold hidden clues or details that may be important.

Action 14: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine statue 4]

Observation 14: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 15: I will continue exploring the roof area, checking each statue for any hidden clues or details that may be important.

Action 15: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine statue 5]

Observation 15: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 16: I will examine the last statue on the railing to see if it holds any hidden clues or details that may be important.

Action 16: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine statue 6]

Observation 16: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 17: I will check the winding staircase leading down from the roof to see if it goes anywhere interesting or holds any clues.

Action 17: InteractiveFictionGame[Go down stairs]

Observation 17: I only understood you as far as wanting to go the floor.

Thought 18: I will clarify my previous action and specify that I want to go down the winding staircase one step at a time to explore further.

Action 18: InteractiveFictionGame[Go down stairs once]

Observation 18: I only understood you as far as wanting to go the floor.

Thought 19: I will clarify my previous action again and specify that I want to go down the winding staircase one step at a time to explore further.

Action 22: InteractiveFictionGame[Go down stairs one step and examine step]

Observation 22: I only understood you as far as wanting to go the floor.

Thought 23: I will try to communicate as clearly as possible and specify that I want to go down the winding staircase one step at a time and carefully examine each step and the area around it for any clues or hidden objects.
