You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends.

Thought 1: I will start the interactive fiction game by taking the initial action.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you."

"What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly.

"Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages."

"And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully.

"A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever.

"But what of Kolchack the --"

"Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!"  He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!"

And with that, you embark on...

New Excavation
You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.

Thought 2: I will check my inventory to see if there are any useful items before exploring the tunnel.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Check inventory]

Observation 2: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 3: I will examine the area around me to see if there are any clues or items I might have missed before entering the tunnel.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine surroundings]

Observation 3: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 4: I will enter the tunnel to explore the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation 4: To shirk your responsibilities to the Inquisitor would mean certain, painful death. This, you reflect, is the most likely outcome in either case, though you are relieved by the thought that grues are not known to dawdle when presented with an appetizing meal.

Thought 5: I will continue exploring the tunnel, keeping an eye out for any potential dangers or useful items.

Thought 8: I will continue exploring the tunnel, keeping an eye out for any potential dangers or useful items. I should also try to conserve my lantern's battery life as much as possible. It would be wise to look for a source of light or additional equipment to make my journey safer and more efficient.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[Search for a source of light or additional equipment]

Observation 8: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 9: I will continue exploring the tunnel, keeping an eye out for any potential dangers or useful items. I should also try to conserve my lantern's battery life as much as possible.
