You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.

After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.
