[{"observation": "A beautiful day in Bostwin! You are awakened by a ray of sunlight peeking through a window shade and rise refreshed after a restful night's sleep.  You've given your Company a weekend pass to get some R&R after your last grueling mission.  Wasting precious little time your entire company took off for the city proper to pack in as much drinking, carousing, brawling, wenching and other relaxing pursuits as possible in 48 hours.  In the fields of battle your men are an elite unit of trained professionals.  Off-duty they're pretty much like every other bunch of soldiers you've ever served with. \n\nA weekend off and what to do? After the challenges of the past year when you were first promoted and assumed command of Charlie Company you've nearly forgotton what free time is and what you're supposed to do with it.\n\nPentari\nAn Interactive Prequel To First Light \nCopyright 1998 (C) Howard A.

When you were a lowly lieutenant you had to share cramped quarters with a fellow lieutenant at your previous assignment.  Commanding a company of your own affords you the luxury of private, spacious quarters just outside the barracks themselves.

In case you're not here are some guidelines for playing:\n\n1) Don't look for any graphics.  This is interactive fiction.  Fine books\ndon't have pictures to accompany the text and neither does this game.\nRead the screen carefully.  It will contain a description of where\nyou are, items which may (or may not) be of use to you and in most\ncases the other directions you can go which lead to other parts of\nthe game.\n\n2) Try to keep it simple.  You don't have to, but try.  This game is\nwritten in Inform by Graham Nelson.  It is quite sophisticated to \nrecognize anything reasonable which may, in some form or fashion,\nhave relevance to the game.\n\n3) Save your game often! You'll probably goof somewhere along the way\nand saving your game will allow you to restore back to your previous\nposition.  If you don't save your games with some degree of frequency\nyou run the risk of having to start all over again from the beginning.\n\n4) Some commands you should be aware of:\n\nsave - Save or 'bookmark' your position in the game at the time of saving. \n\nrestore - Load in the last game saved or resume where you are bookmarked. \n\nrestart - Will restart your game from the beginning. \n\nquit - Abbreviated as q.  Will quit the game when you say so. \n\nundo - If you goofed somewhere, this will undo your last turn. \n\nscore - Shows your progress in the game so far. \n\nn,s,e,w - The 4 primary directions.  these will navigate you through\nthe game.  In addition, ne, se, sw, nw, up, down, in or out\nare also good to remember.\n\nagain - Abbreviated as g.  This will repeat the last command entered. \n\nexamine - Abbreviated as x.  This is useful to take a closer look\nat something such as: EXAMINE THE SCROLL \n\nlook - Will give you a description of the room you are currently in. \n\ntake <it", "reward": 0, "moves": 8, "score": 0, "action": "Help"}, {"observation": "You can't see any such thing.", "reward": 0, "moves": 8, "score": 0, "action": "Examine the Pentarian Transporter"}, {"observation": "I only understood you as far as wanting to look.", "reward": 0, "moves": 8, "score": 0, "action": "Look around"}, {"observation": "I only understood you as far as wanting to look.", "reward": 0, "moves": 8, "score": 0, "action": "Look around for the Pentarian Transporter"}, {"observation": "You can't see any such thing.", "reward": 0, "moves": 8, "score": 0, "action": "Search the area carefully for the Pentarian Transporter"}, {"observation": "These are ordinary metallic lockers, painted an olive green.", "reward": 0, "moves": 9, "score": 0, "action": "Examine the lockers"}, {"observation": "You can't see any such thing.", "reward": 0, "moves": 9, "score": 0, "action": "Open the nearest locker"}, {"observation": "You can't see any such thing.", "reward": 0, "moves": 9, "score": 0, "action": "Open the locker with the key if present"}, {"observation": "You can't see any such thing.", "reward": 0, "moves": 9, "score": 0, "action": "Examine the contents of the nearest locker"}, {"observation": "You can't see any such thing.", "reward": 0, "moves": 9, "score": 0, "action": "Open the nearest locker] and InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the contents of the locker"}, {"observation": "Charlie Company Compound", "reward": 0, "moves": 10, "score": 0, "action": "Go south"}, {"observation": "Why would you want to inspect the Company's supply cache when you have a whole weekend off?", "reward": 0, "moves": 11, "score": 0, "action": "Go west"}, {"observation": "You can't see any such thing.", "reward": 0, "moves": 11, "score": 0, "action": "Go back] and InteractiveFictionGame[Check the supply building for useful or interesting items for me or my company"}, {"observation": "That's not a verb I recognise.", "reward": 0, "moves": 11, "score": 0, "action": "Inspect the supply building for any useful or interesting items for me or my company"}, {"observation": "You can't see any such thing.", "reward": 0, "moves": 11, "score": 0, "action": "Examine the supply building for any useful or interesting items for me or my company"}, {"observation": "You can't see any such thing.", "reward": 0, "moves": 11, "score": 0, "action": "Search the supply building carefully for any useful or interesting items for me or my company"}, {"observation": "It's considered a breach of protocol to enter the compound of another company while training.
