(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends.

Thought 1: I will start the interactive fiction game by taking the initial action.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
You awaken in your tent, lying on the floor, with a hangover like you wouldn't believe. As you lever yourself up, you notice that there is complete silence instead of the usual morning complaints of the workers and Roboff's usual shouting. This can only mean one thing - Roboff must have finally run off on you. Panicked, you look around and see your amulet lying on the floor. At least Roboff had the sense to not trigger off your alarm. Knowing him, he also had the sense to take the emergency radio. How the megakrip are you going to get out of this one?

First-time players should type "about".

In Your Tent
You are in your tent in the encampment. The tent appears to have been completely cleaned out. It is very hot in here and getting hotter. The tent flap to the south is open.
On the ground is the ancient jeweled amulet that you "borrowed" from Mr. Meshugge.

Thought 2: I should check my inventory to see if there's anything else useful before leaving the tent.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Check inventory]

Observation 2: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 3: I should explore the encampment to look for any useful items or clues.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Go south]

Observation 3:
Center of Camp
This is the center of your camp. The entire place seems to be completely deserted. You can see Roboff's tent to the south and the storage tent west. East is open desert.

Thought 4: I should check Roboff's tent to see if there's anything useful or if I can find any clues about what happened to him.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[Go south]

Observation 4:
Roboff's Tent
You are in Francisco Roboff's tent. The place is bare except for the emergency signal radio and Roboff's toilet in one corner. There is a note taped to the tent wall.

Thought 5: I should read the note to see if it provides any information about Roboff's whereabouts or what might have happened to him.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[Read note]

Observation 5:
"Hi. Sorry about running off so suddenly but you know how it is... With luck, you will die, but I want you to have something to do while you starve so I'll tell you how to find the pyramid. Oh, I didn't mention that I found it two weeks ago? I never got in because the door is opened by putting that amulet of yours into a little slot. Anyway, go to the middle of camp and go east four times and north once. Dig there. Have fun!
   -F. Roboff"

Thought 6: I should follow the instructions in the note to find the pyramid and possibly find Roboff or some valuable treasure.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east, go east, go east, go east, go north, dig]

Observation 6: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

Thought 7: I should go to each location mentioned in the note and perform the necessary actions to find the pyramid.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east, Go east, Go east, Go east]

Observation 7: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

Thought 8: I should go to each location mentioned in the note one at a time and perform the necessary actions to find the pyramid.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation 8: You can't go that way.

Thought 9: I must have made a mistake in interpreting the directions. Let me check the note again. Thought 9: I should go west instead of east to reach the location mentioned in the note.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation 9: You can't go that way.

Thought 10: I must have made a mistake in interpreting the directions. Let me check the note again. Thought 10: I should go north instead of west to reach the location mentioned in the note.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Thought 11: I made a mistake in my previous thought. I should have gone east four times instead of going north once.
