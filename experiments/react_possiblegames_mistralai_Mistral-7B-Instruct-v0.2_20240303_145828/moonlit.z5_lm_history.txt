Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends.

Thought 1: I will start the interactive fiction game by taking the initial action.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
No, not a prison, though stone stands around you, as expressionless as a mirror awaiting face and form; and in the silence you hear no plaint of flute or roar of gong, but instead the crash of porcelain shattering.

Release 1 / Serial number 020927 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 

Moonlit Chamber
Moonlight diffuses through the walls, tracing out unreadable sigils in calligraphies of light and dark. Stairs adorned with bas-relief motifs spiral downward.

You can see a porcelain mask here.

Thought 2: I will examine the porcelain mask to gather more information about it.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine mask]

Observation 2: The half-mask is the pale, almost bluish color of the finest celadon, cracked with uncanny precision down its axis of symmetry. The face in its blank, sculpted features has no more personality than new-forged steel. Half a mask, though--that must mean the left half is--

Thought 3: I will look for the other half of the mask to complete it.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation 3: The walls confine you as surely as the skeleton constrains the flesh, or the sheath constrains the sword.

Thought 4: I will check my inventory to see if I have any items that could help me find the other half of the mask.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[Check inventory]

Observation 4: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 5: I will explore the chamber further to see if I can find any clues or hidden compartments that may contain the other half of the mask.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[Search room]

Observation 5: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 6: I will continue exploring the chamber by checking other areas or objects that might contain the other half of the mask.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine stairs]

Observation 6: Each step is carved upon the side in bas-relief, though the design is abstract.

Thought 7: I will examine the bas-relief designs on the stairs more closely to see if they hold any clues or resemble the mask in any way.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine bas-relief designs on stairs]

Observation 7: I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the bas-relief.

Thought 8: I will examine the bas-relief designs on the stairs more closely for any clues or patterns that may help me find the other half of the mask.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine bas-relief designs on stairs in detail]

Observation 8: I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the bas-relief.

Thought 12: I will try to communicate even more clearly with the game by providing a specific action related to examining the bas-relief designs on the stairs. Thought 12: I will closely inspect each bas-relief design on the stairs, comparing their features to the porcelain mask to see if any match or provide a clue to its location.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[Closely inspect each bas-relief design on the stairs, comparing their features to the porcelain mask to see if any match or provide a clue to its location]
