This has never been your favorite part of the city.  Nor is this neighborhood the safest one.  But as a city sanitarian, you are charged with completing an annual health and safety inspection of every restaurant in your district.

Each day you visit three or four restaurants.  During those visits you take note of potential health code violations in your trusty notepad.  Today's first target:  Nikolai's Bar and Grill.

A hazy sun barely peeks above the three-story tenements.

19th Street
You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street.  A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room.  The front entrance is north of you.

The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with broken bottles.  Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically.  A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak.

An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

A damp sheet of newspaper has blown up against the curb.
> Check placard and newspaper
You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
> Check placard
An aluminum placard, printed in red, is fixed to the front door.
> Check newspaper
The newspaper scrap is worn and damp, rendering it almost unreadable.
> Go north
(first opening the front door)
(first unlocking the front door)
You lack a key that fits the front door.
> Check inventory
You can't see any such thing.
> Examine surroundings for clues
You can't see any such thing.
> Ask neighbors for help
You can't see any such thing.
> Try to force open the door
That's not a verb I recognise.
> Search surroundings for a tool
You can't see any such thing.
> Look for contact information for the restaurant owner
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> Search surroundings for contact information
You can't see any such thing.
> Move on to next inspection location
You can't see any such thing.

About Interactive FictionThe game you are playing is a work of Interactive Fiction.  In interactive fiction you play the main character of a story.

Getting StartedThe first thing you want to do when starting a game is acquaint yourself with your surroundings and get a sense of your goal. To this end, you should read the introductory text carefully. Sometimes it contains clues. You will also want to look at the room you are in. Notice where the exits from the room are, and what objects are described here. If any of these seem interesting, you may want to EXAMINE them. 

You might also want to examine yourself (EXAMINE ME) to see whether the author has left you any clues about your character. TAKE INVENTORY will tell you what you're carrying, as well.

Once you've gotten your bearings, you may want to explore. Move from room to room, and check out every location available.
