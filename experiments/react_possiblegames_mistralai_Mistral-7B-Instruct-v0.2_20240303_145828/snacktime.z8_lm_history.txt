Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends.

Thought 1: I will start the interactive fiction game by taking the initial action.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
<RRROWWGRROWL> Your stomach growls.

You've been vegging out in front of that flickering screen for hours, your pet by your side. Now your complaining stomach sets you up on your feet, and on a mission.

Snack Time!

(For more information please type ABOUT)

Sitting Room
This is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food. That is a good room.

Even though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of "no"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.

Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.

Thought 2: I will go to the room with the food to find something to satisfy my hunger.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation 2:
Food Room
Food room, glorious food room!

Your bowl for food and water is here, but that's only the beginning. There's also a lot of secret places where your pet keeps food and things that go with food and things that make food better. There's a thing that gets hot and a box that stays cold, and that is your favorite because you know there is always food inside there. A cloth hangs down from the door of the cold box.

Thought 3: I will check the cold box to see if there is any food inside.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Take the cloth and open the cold box]

Observation 9:
Sleeping Room
Most of the time when you are in here it is dark and quiet because that is the best way to sleep and this is the room made for sleeping. There is a high bed here that is not your bed although it is where you sleep usually to keep your pet company. The sitting room is south of here and the room with the water is to the west.

Your low bed is here, looking all soft and cushy.

Dino is here!

Thought 10: I will check if there is any food on the low bed or nearby.
