Bedroom (in bed)
This bedroom is extremely spare, with dirty laundry scattered haphazardly all over the floor. Cleaner clothing can be found in the dresser. A bathroom lies to the south, while a door to the east leads to the living room.

On the end table are a telephone, a wallet and some keys.

The phone rings.

Thought 2: I should answer the phone before it goes to voicemail. I'll take the action to answer the phone.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Answer phone]

Observation 2:
You pick up the phone. "Hadley!" a shrill voice cries. "Hadley, haven't you even left yet?? You knew that our presentation was at nine o'clock sharp! First the thing with the printers, now this - there won't even be enough left of you for Bowman to fire once he's done with you. Now get the hell down here!!"

Click.

Thought 3: I need to get to the presentation on time. I'll check my inventory to see if I have anything that can help me get there faster.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Check inventory]

Observation 3: [!: Verb error. (This generally means that the first word of your command was not recognized.)]

Thought 4: I apologize for the error in my previous action. I should have used the correct verb. I'll check my inventory instead.

Observation 8:
Living room
The furniture isn't as carefully arranged as one might like, and it's a bit lacking in the luxuries that might make this a more pleasant place to spend an evening - no stereo, no TV, no DVD, none of that - but this living room is still nicer than most of those in this neighborhood. A kitchenette lies to the east, the bedroom to the west and the front door to the south.

Thought 9: I should check the kitchenette to see if there's anything I can use to get to the presentation on time, such as a map or public transportation information.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation 9:
Kitchenette
You don't really have time to poke around and cook yourself a fabulous breakfast right now. Best to keep your time here limited. The exit is west.

Thought 10: I should take the Pop-Tart with me as a quick source of energy to help me get to the presentation on time.
