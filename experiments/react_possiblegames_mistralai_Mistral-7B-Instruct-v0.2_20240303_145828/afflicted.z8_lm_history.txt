Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends.

Thought 1: I will start the interactive fiction game by taking the initial action.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
This has never been your favorite part of the city.  Nor is this neighborhood the safest one.  But as a city sanitarian, you are charged with completing an annual health and safety inspection of every restaurant in your district.

Each day you visit three or four restaurants.  During those visits you take note of potential health code violations in your trusty notepad.  Today's first target:  Nikolai's Bar and Grill.

A hazy sun barely peeks above the three-story tenements.

Afflicted
An Interactive Fiction by Doug Egan
Release 1 / Serial number 080906 / Inform 7 build 5T18 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) 

Type "About" at any time to see game instructions and other notes from the author.

19th Street
You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street.  A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room.  The front entrance is north of you.

The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with broken bottles.  Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically.  A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak.

An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

A damp sheet of newspaper has blown up against the curb.

Thought 2: I will check the placard and the newspaper for any relevant information before entering the restaurant.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Check placard and newspaper]

Observation 2: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

Thought 3: I will check the placard first, then the newspaper.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Check placard]

Observation 3: An aluminum placard, printed in red, is fixed to the front door.

Thought 4: I will now check the newspaper for any relevant information.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[Check newspaper]

Observation 4: The newspaper scrap is worn and damp, rendering it almost unreadable.

Thought 5: I will enter the restaurant to begin my inspection despite the unreadable newspaper and the ominous appearance of the neighborhood.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation 5:
(first opening the front door)
(first unlocking the front door)
You lack a key that fits the front door.

Thought 6: I will check my inventory for a key that might open the door before attempting to enter the restaurant.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[Check inventory]

Observation 6: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 7: I will try to find a way to obtain a key or find another entrance to the restaurant before giving up and moving on to the next inspection.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine surroundings for clues]

Observation 7: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 8: I will try to look for a hidden key or ask someone in the neighborhood if they have a key or know of another entrance to Nikolai's Bar and Grill.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[Ask neighbors for help]

Observation 8: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 9: I will try to find a way to force open the door or look for alternative means to enter the restaurant without a key.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[Try to force open the door]

Observation 9: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 10: I will try to find a tool or object that can help me force open the door.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[Search surroundings for a tool]

Observation 10: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 11: I will reconsider my approach and try to find alternative ways to enter the restaurant or contact the restaurant owner for a key.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[Look for contact information for the restaurant owner]

Observation 11: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought 12: I will search the area for any contact information for the restaurant owner, such as a phone number or address where I can reach them.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[Search surroundings for contact information]

Observation 12: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 13: I will consider my options and decide whether to come back later when the owner might be present, or move on to the next inspection location.

Action 13: InteractiveFictionGame[Move on to next inspection location]

Observation 13: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 14: I will check if there is a way to interact with the author or game creator for assistance or clues.

Action 14: InteractiveFictionGame[About]

Observation 14: Instructions  N = NextQ = Quit Menu P = PreviousENTER = Selec

Thought 16: I have checked the instructions provided by the game, but they do not seem to provide any information on how to proceed with the current situation. I will continue searching for a way to enter the restaurant or contact the owner.

Observation 49:
Getting StartedThe first thing you want to do when starting a game is acquaint yourself with your surroundings and get a sense of your goal. To this end, you should read the introductory text carefully. Sometimes it contains clues. You will also want to look at the room you are in. Notice where the exits from the room are, and what objects are described here. If any of these seem interesting, you may want to EXAMINE them. 

You might also want to examine yourself (EXAMINE ME) to see whether the author has left you any clues about your character. TAKE INVENTORY will tell you what you're carrying, as well.

Once you've gotten your bearings, you may want to explore. Move from room to room, and check out every location available.
