You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

Release 1 / Serial number 000715 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 SD

<< Chief's office >>
You are standing in the Chief's office. He is telling you "The Mayor was murdered yeaterday night at 12:03 am. I want you to solve it before we get any bad publicity or the FBI has to come in. "Yessir!" You reply. He hands you a sheet of paper. Once you have read it, go north or west.

You can see a piece of white paper here.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

Thought 2: I will read the paper given by the chief to gather more information about the case.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Read the paper]

Observation 2:
CONFIDENTIAL:
Detective was created by Matt Barringer.
He has worked hard on this so you better enjoy it.
I did have fun making it though. But I'd REALLY appreciate it if you were kind enough to send a postcard or... dare I even say it?... money... to:
Matt Barringer
325 Olive Ave
Piedmont

Just tell me if you like it or not.
If you want to talk to me over a BBS call the Ghostbuster Central BBS at (510)208-5657.
There is an Exile Games file area. Have fun. I WILL give hints out over the BBS to any of my games.

Thought 3: I will check the paper for any relevant information related to the murder case. I notice there is a contact number for the Ghostbuster Central BBS where the author may provide hints. I will make a note of it for future reference.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Check inventory]

Observation 3: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 4: I will go to the Ghostbuster Central BBS using the given phone number to check if there are any hints related to the murder case.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[Call Ghostbuster Central BBS at (510)208-5657]

Observation 4: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 5: I will look for a way to access the BBS in the game instead of directly calling the number. I will check the game's instructions or explore the environment for a terminal or a computer I can use to connect to the BBS.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the desk or look for a computer]

Observation 5: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 6: I will go west to explore the rest of the room and look for any clues or objects that might help me access the BBS or gather more information about the murder case.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation 6:
<< Closet >>
You are in a closet. There is a gun on the floor. Better get it. To exit, go east.

You can see a small black pistol here.

Thought 7: I will pick up the gun for potential use later and then go back to the chief's office to explore further or try accessing the BBS from there.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[Take the gun]

Observation 7:
Taken.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

Thought 8: I will go back to the chief's office and try to access the BBS from there using any available terminal or computer.

Thought 9: I will examine the paper again to see if there is any new information or hidden instructions for accessing the BBS.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the paper]

Observation 9: It is a piece of white paper.

Thought 10: I will check the rest of the room for any hidden objects or clues that might help me access the BBS or gather more information about the murder case.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[Search the room]

Observation 10: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 11: I will go north to explore the next room or area in the building, as there might be a terminal or computer there that I can use to access the BBS or find more information related to the murder case.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation 11:
<< Outside >>
You are outside in the cold. To the east is a dead end. To the west is the rest of the street. Papers are blowing around. It's amazingly cold for this time of year.

Thought 12: I will explore the rest of the street to the west to see if there is any important information or clues related to the murder case.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation 12:
<< Outside >>
You are still on the streets. To the north is a restraunt where the mayor ate often. To the east is the Mayor's home.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

Thought 13: I will go to the restaurant where the mayor often ate to see if there is any information or clues related to the murder case.

Action 13: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation 13:
<< Restraunt >>
You are about to enter the restraunt when two guys jump you. They take your wallet and beat you a bit. Then you flash your badge and that riles them. Your body was discovered in a river 10 miles away.


    *** You have died ***


In that game you scored 30 out of a possible 360, in 8 turns.

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, give the FULL score for that game or QUIT?

Thought 14: I will restart the game to continue exploring and gathering information to solve the murder case.

You are standing in the Chief's office. He is telling you "The Mayor was murdered yeaterday night at 12:03 am. I want you to solve it before we get any bad publicity or the FBI has to come in. "Yessir!" You reply. He hands you a sheet of paper. Once you have read it, go north or west.

Just tell me if you like it or not.
