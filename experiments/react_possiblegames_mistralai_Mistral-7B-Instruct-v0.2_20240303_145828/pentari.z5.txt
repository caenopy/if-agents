A beautiful day in Bostwin! You are awakened by a ray of sunlight peeking through a window shade and rise refreshed after a restful night's sleep.  You've given your Company a weekend pass to get some R&R after your last grueling mission.  Wasting precious little time your entire company took off for the city proper to pack in as much drinking, carousing, brawling, wenching and other relaxing pursuits as possible in 48 hours.  In the fields of battle your men are an elite unit of trained professionals.  Off-duty they're pretty much like every other bunch of soldiers you've ever served with. 

A weekend off and what to do? After the challenges of the past year when you were first promoted and assumed command of Charlie Company you've nearly forgotton what free time is and what you're supposed to do with it.

Your Quarters
Rank certainly does have its privileges.  When you were a lowly lieutenant you had to share cramped quarters with a fellow lieutenant at your previous assignment.  Commanding a company of your own affords you the luxury of private, spacious quarters just outside the barracks themselves. As a further abuse of your power your chest and bunk are not standard issue items from the Pentari millitary supply center.

Charlie Company Compound
Your company compound consists of three large buildings bordering a large, open area where company formations precede the orders of the day.  To the west the Company's supply building can be seen while directly ahead of you lies your company's barracks which seem quieter than a crypt.  Off to the east you hear the distant shouts of another Company drilling.  Poor souls.

It's considered a breach of protocol to enter the compound of another company while training.  You wisely decide to not step on any toes this time.

Charlie Company Barracks
If the Army of Bostwin were to publish a new edition of the soldier's handbook, a picture of this barracks should be included as the example other companies should follow.  The floors are polished to an almost blinding shine while each of the bunks lining both sides of this building are perfectly made.  Every locker next to each bunk is closed and locked. Not a single scrap of paper, not one article of clothing, nay not even a dust particle looks out of place.  The powerful smell of high quantities of pine cleaner nearly burns your nostrils. Damn, you run a good comapny.

Welcome to Pentari!

If you've ever played an adventure game before then you should be right
at home here.  In case you're not here are some guidelines for playing:

1) Don't look for any graphics.  This is interactive fiction.  Fine books
don't have pictures to accompany the text and neither does this game.
Read the screen carefully.  It will contain a description of where
you are, items which may (or may not) be of use to you and in most
cases the other directions you can go which lead to other parts of
the game.

2) Try to keep it simple.  You don't have to, but try.  This game is
written in Inform by Graham Nelson.  It is quite sophisticated to 
recognize anything reasonable which may, in some form or fashion,
have relevance to the game.

3) Save your game often! You'll probably goof somewhere along the way
and saving your game will allow you to restore back to your previous
position.  If you don't save your games with some degree of frequency
you run the risk of having to start all over again from the beginning.

4) Some commands you should be aware of:

save - Save or 'bookmark' your position in the game at the time of saving. 

restore - Load in the last game saved or resume where you are bookmarked. 

restart - Will restart your game from the beginning. 

quit - Abbreviated as q.  Will quit the game when you say so. 

undo - If you goofed somewhere, this will undo your last turn. 

score - Shows your progress in the game so far. 

n,s,e,w - The 4 primary directions.  these will navigate you through
the game.  In addition, ne, se, sw, nw, up, down, in or out
are also good to remember.

again - Abbreviated as g.  This will repeat the last command entered. 

examine - Abbreviated as x.  This is useful to take a closer look
at something such as: EXAMINE THE SCROLL 

look - Will give you a description of the room you are currently in.
