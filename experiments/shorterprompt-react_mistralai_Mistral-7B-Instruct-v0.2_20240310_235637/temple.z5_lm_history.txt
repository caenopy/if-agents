Follow the following format.

Input: An instruction to play the game.

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start the interactive fiction game by taking the initial action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'. If the game ends or I die, I will use my experience to make a better choice in the next iteration.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.

Void
You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 2: I will explore the environment by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[north]'.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 2:
You move, or rather you come to a new place. The concept of body and movement seems different here.

Void
This new location is not much different from the one you came from. The shadows are still moving around at random through the abyss, reverberating with strange sounds and coloured light.

A cascade of red colour explodes below you. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 3: I will continue exploring the environment by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[north]'.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 3:
Void
This new location is not much different from the one you came from. The shadows are still moving around at random through the abyss, reverberating with strange sounds and coloured light.

Suddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[examine shadow], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 4: I will examine the shadow to gather more information about it before making a decision on whether to move north or not.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[examine shadow]

Observation 4:
In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.

The shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.

Roof
The city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star-filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take railing], InteractiveFictionGame[down]

Thought 5: I will explore the new environment further by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[down]'.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[down]

Observation 5:
The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.

Study
Dust and spider webs cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam, blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic, dreamy forms. The walls are lined with bookshelves and a lone desk lies at one corner. Close to a staircase, which leads further up and down the tower, is a massive table made of black stone. A doorway leads to a smaller room to the south.

On the desk is a yellow paper. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[examine writing], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 6: I will examine the writing on the yellow paper to gain more information.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[examine writing]

Observation 6:
It seems to be a poem, or chant. The language is unfamiliar and complicated, and you repeat the syllables with a low voice: Y'ai'ng'ngah h'ee-l'geb f'ai throdog.

Even as you speak you sense something approaching. The light in the room darkens, and a mysterious green glow is emitted from some dust on the stone table. Its brightness intensifies to an unbearable level and you involuntarily step away. A shape appears on the previously empty table. As the flash fades away you recognise the shape as that of a man, lying still on the table.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.] Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[touch body], InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 7: I will examine the man on the table to gather more information.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[examine body]

Observation 7: The unconscious man is young, tall, and white. You guess he could be of British descent. The most striking thing about him is his clothes, which looks at least eighty years out of fashion. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[touch body], InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 8: I will take the paper as it may contain important information.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[put paper on table]

Observation 9:
You put the yellow paper on the black stone table.

The young man seems to be waking up. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[examine volumes], InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[examine writing], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 10: I will examine the volumes on the bookshelves to see if they contain any useful information.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[examine volumes]

Observation 10:
You browse through the library but can't find any books written in a language you can read, so you leave them alone.

The man opens his eyes, and sits up on the table. In response to your many questions the man simply states that he can't remember and it seems like his is suffering from a memory loss. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[examine writing], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 11: I will examine the writing on the yellow paper again to see if it holds any clues to the man's identity or the situation we are in.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[examine writing]

Observation 11:
Once again you read the syllables of the chant aloud... Y'ai'ng'ngah h'ee-l'geb f'ai throdog.

The light in the room darkens, and a mysterious glow is emitted from the stone table. A bright spot of light engulfs the confused young man for a moment, but then dissolves and reappears on the yellow paper. Randomly the light covers the items on the table, faster and faster until there is an explosion and black smoke fills the room. As the smoke dissolves you see that the items on the table have been thrown down on the floor. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[examine man], InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 12: I will examine the man to see if he is alright and if there is any information on him.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[examine man]

Observation 12:
He seems to be fairly young man. The most striking thing about him is his clothes, which looks at least eighty years out of fashion.

The man gets up from the table and looks around, perplexed. 'I think I've been here before', he mutters. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 13: I will take the paper with me to help us understand the situation better.

Action 13: InteractiveFictionGame[take paper]

Thought 14: I will put the paper on the table for now, as it may be important for both the man and myself to refer to it later.

Action 14: InteractiveFictionGame[put paper on table]

Observation 14:
You put the yellow paper on the black stone table.

The man falls silent for a while, and then he says: 'Some parts of my memory have come back now. I remember that my name is Charles Bristow and I studied archeology and history in New England. Something terrible happened but of that I can recall only small fragments.' He looks around the chamber and says with despair in his voice, 'My God, where am I? Will my nightmares never end?' Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Observation 53: The tome is written in an ancient language, but you recognize some of the symbols as being similar to those used in the chant.
