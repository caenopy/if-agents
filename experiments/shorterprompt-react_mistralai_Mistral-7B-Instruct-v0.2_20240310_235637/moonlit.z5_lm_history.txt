You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Input: An instruction to play the game.

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start the interactive fiction game by taking the initial action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'. If the game ends or I die, I will use my experience to make a better choice in the next iteration.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
No, not a prison, though stone stands around you, as expressionless as a mirror awaiting face and form; and in the silence you hear no plaint of flute or roar of gong, but instead the crash of porcelain shattering.

Release 1 / Serial number 020927 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 

Moonlit Chamber
Moonlight diffuses through the walls, tracing out unreadable sigils in calligraphies of light and dark. Stairs adorned with bas-relief motifs spiral downward.

You can see a porcelain mask here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take egg], InteractiveFictionGame[take mask], InteractiveFictionGame[get in stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[take all], InteractiveFictionGame[push mask to stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[down]

Thought 3: I will continue down the stairs to explore further.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[down]

Observation 3:
Shadow Armory
Shadows gather around you. For a moment, dregs of light defined by the negative space take on the shapes of maple leaf, kite, comb, and other shapes that flicker across the walls too rapidly for you to interpret.

Curiously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.

Northward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take dagger], InteractiveFictionGame[get in stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[push dagger to stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 4:
The shapes of light you saw as you entered fade irrevocably.


Undying Garden
Barren branches and pines suggest winter's quiet. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.

A jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, between translucence and opacity, curve and line, and other dichotomies too subtle for your eye. A gentle warmth from the surface invites touch.

Transactions of light show other rooms southward and westward.

You can see a tortoise-shell comb here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take other], InteractiveFictionGame[turn needle], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[take other with comb], InteractiveFictionGame[hit other], InteractiveFictionGame[turn needle to swallow], InteractiveFictionGame[turn needle to crane], InteractiveFictionGame[turn needle to hawk], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on compass], InteractiveFictionGame[push other to compass], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Thought 6: I will explore the room to the west to see what I can find.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Observation 6:
Skeletal Banquet
It seems this is a banquet room, if a banquet had no especial place for people to dine. Glassware and stoneware are arranged in deliberate shapes, as though they are constellations. 

South lies a chamber of brooding silence, and a vague, sweet fragrance comes from the east. Stairs of blackest marble lead downward.

On the table are a banquet of bones and some ivory chopsticks. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take chopsticks], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[get in marble], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[hit bones], InteractiveFictionGame[take all off table], InteractiveFictionGame[push chopsticks to table], InteractiveFictionGame[push chopsticks to marble], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on table], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on marble]

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Observation 10:
Silent Symphony
A single bronze gong hangs from its wooden frame in the room's center. There are also silk cushions arranged around the floor in a court ensemble's traditional half-circle, but no bamboo flutes or clay ocarinas, nine-stringed zithers or singers' unfolding fans, are in evidence. A mural that touches each wall in turn gives the room an illusion of greater depth. 

Two entrances, one east, one north; the former is wrapped in shadow, the latter in light.

Thought 34: I will explore the room to the east, as it might contain new discoveries and I haven't checked it thoroughly yet.

Action 34: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 34:
Undying Garden
Barren branches and pines suggest winter's quiet. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.

A jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, between translucence and opacity, curve and line, and other dichotomies too subtle for your eye. A gentle warmth from the surface invites touch.

Transactions of light show other rooms southward and westward.

Skeletal Banquet
It seems this is a banquet room, if a banquet had no especial place for people to dine. Glassware and stoneware are arranged in deliberate shapes, as though they are constellations.

Observation 36:
Silent Symphony
A single bronze gong hangs from its wooden frame in the room's center. There are also silk cushions arranged around the floor in a court ensemble's traditional half-circle, but no bamboo flutes or clay ocarinas, nine-stringed zithers or singers' unfolding fans, are in evidence. A mural that touches each wall in turn gives the room an illusion of greater depth.
