Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.

Void
You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north]
> north
You move, or rather you come to a new place. The concept of body and movement seems different here.

Void
This new location is not much different from the one you came from. The shadows are still moving around at random through the abyss, reverberating with strange sounds and coloured light.

A cascade of red colour explodes below you. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Void
This new location is not much different from the one you came from. The shadows are still moving around at random through the abyss, reverberating with strange sounds and coloured light.

Suddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[examine shadow], InteractiveFictionGame[north]
> examine shadow
In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.

The shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.

Roof
The city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star-filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take railing], InteractiveFictionGame[down]
> down
The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.

Study
Dust and spider webs cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam, blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic, dreamy forms. The walls are lined with bookshelves and a lone desk lies at one corner. Close to a staircase, which leads further up and down the tower, is a massive table made of black stone. A doorway leads to a smaller room to the south.

On the desk is a yellow paper. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[examine writing], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[up]
> examine writing
It seems to be a poem, or chant. The language is unfamiliar and complicated, and you repeat the syllables with a low voice: Y'ai'ng'ngah h'ee-l'geb f'ai throdog.

Even as you speak you sense something approaching. The light in the room darkens, and a mysterious green glow is emitted from some dust on the stone table. Its brightness intensifies to an unbearable level and you involuntarily step away. A shape appears on the previously empty table. As the flash fades away you recognise the shape as that of a man, lying still on the table.

The unconscious man is young, tall, and white. You guess he could be of British descent. The most striking thing about him is his clothes, which looks at least eighty years out of fashion.

The young man seems to be waking up. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[examine volumes], InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[examine writing], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[up]
> examine volumes
You browse through the library but can't find any books written in a language you can read, so you leave them alone.

The man opens his eyes, and sits up on the table. In response to your many questions the man simply states that he can't remember and it seems like his is suffering from a memory loss. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[examine writing], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[up]
> examine writing
Once again you read the syllables of the chant aloud... Y'ai'ng'ngah h'ee-l'geb f'ai throdog.

The light in the room darkens, and a mysterious glow is emitted from the stone table. A bright spot of light engulfs the confused young man for a moment, but then dissolves and reappears on the yellow paper. Randomly the light covers the items on the table, faster and faster until there is an explosion and black smoke fills the room. As the smoke dissolves you see that the items on the table have been thrown down on the floor.

He seems to be fairly young man. The most striking thing about him is his clothes, which looks at least eighty years out of fashion.

The man gets up from the table and looks around, perplexed. 'I think I've been here before', he mutters. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

You put the yellow paper on the black stone table.

The man falls silent for a while, and then he says: 'Some parts of my memory have come back now. I remember that my name is Charles Bristow and I studied archeology and history in New England. Something terrible happened but of that I can recall only small fragments.' He looks around the chamber and says with despair in his voice, 'My God, where am I? Will my nightmares never end?'
