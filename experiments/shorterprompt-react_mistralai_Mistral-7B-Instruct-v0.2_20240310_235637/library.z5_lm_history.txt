You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Input: An instruction to play the game.

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start the interactive fiction game by taking the initial action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'. If the game ends or I die, I will use my experience to make a better choice in the next iteration.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

You are a student at Anycollege, in Anytown, and it's the end of the semester!  You've been slacking off all semester long, and it's catching up to you. That final paper is due for your Computer Science class ("The History of IF Games"), and you desperately need to check out a comprehensive book on Graham Nelson, one of the foremost authors of the obscure genre of interactive-fiction. You know there is exactly one such book, but you have no idea where it might be! 

The first time player should probably type "help".

ALL QUIET ON THE LIBRARY FRONT
An Interactive Vignette

Standard interpreter 1.0

Lobby
This is the entrance to the library. The circulation desk dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of desks and tables. A pair of security gates stands before the front doors to prevent people from stealing books. A card catalog lurks in a dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh flourescent light. Glass doors to the west lead to the book stacks; an archway to the northwest is labelled "Duplicating Services"; a door to the north bears a sign marked "Private" in large friendly letters; and the exit is to the east

You can see a circulation desk attendant here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[xyzzy], InteractiveFictionGame[close drawer], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[take into northwest], InteractiveFictionGame[put card down], InteractiveFictionGame[examine door], InteractiveFictionGame[open drawer], InteractiveFictionGame[give card id]

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Observation 2:
You push the glass doors open. Their hydraulics hiss faintly.

Ground Floor Stacks
This cavernous room is lit with flickering flourescent lighting which makes the ceiling look even lower than it really is. It is filled with half-empty shelves, upon which rest the dusty boxes of many early games. To one side sits a massive, ancient desk, its surface cluttered with paperwork. A sign on the wall indicates that this is the reference desk, which would make the prim young woman sitting behind it the reference librarian. A doorway to the north is labelled "Stairs", and glass doors lead east to the lobby.

You can see a reference librarian here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[xyzzy], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[put card down]

Thought 3: I will approach the reference librarian and ask for help finding a book on Graham Nelson.

Observation 7:
Second Floor Stacks
You are in a maze of twisty shelves, all alike.

(Well, okay, not really)

This cavernous room is filled with shelves as far as the eye can see. A doorway to the east is labelled "Computer Room", and the stairwell lies to the north.

A heavy wooden door bars the way to the rare books room. A sign indicates that the key may be obtained from the circulation desk. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[xyzzy], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[look in books]

Action 17: InteractiveFictionGame[east] (to go to the Computer Room)

Observation 17:
Computer Lab
This entire room hums with the combined output of several dozen computers. All of them are hopelessly out of date, but at least they're still good for word processing.

A bank of printers on one side of the room frantically churns out paper.

You can see a technician here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[xyzzy], InteractiveFictionGame[examine manual]

Thought 18: I will approach the technician and ask if they have any information about the "Advanced Interactive Fiction" section or the book on Graham Nelson.

Action 19: InteractiveFictionGame[examine manual]

Observation 19:
This is a very complicated and technical manual. Hmmmm, maybe you'd understand it better if you had concentrated on hardware instead of software. Quite frankly, the circuit diagrams and instructions are incomprehensible. Better leave that sort of work to a professional!

On the other hand, it would make a nice door stop. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[xyzzy]
