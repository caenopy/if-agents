You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Input: An instruction to play the game.

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start the interactive fiction game by taking the initial action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'. If the game ends or I die, I will use my experience to make a better choice in the next iteration.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
You remember darkness. And the cold. Cold and darkness. And silence. Those memories are all that you have. That, and a feeling that something you never knew you possessed has been lost.

Suddenly, oblivion is split by a blinding light and a crash of sound. You awaken to the roar of a storm and a deluge of rain and mud.

In the Mud
Rain and muddy water are pouring down on you, making it difficult to see or even breathe. Sodden earth and mud surrounds you on all sides except overhead, where flashes of lightning illuminate a storm tossed sky. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[put mud under water], InteractiveFictionGame[put water under mud], InteractiveFictionGame[put rain under mud], InteractiveFictionGame[put sky under mud], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Observation 2:
As you scramble out of the hole the mud collapses downward, filling in the hole behind you.

Graveyard
Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The only exit is through the gate to the east.

A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the graveyard.

A large branch has been broken from one of the trees and has crushed the grave marker below it.

Observation 3:
West Side of the Church
This side of the church is untended and grasses and weeds have run rampant. A muddy trail leads back to the graveyard to the west and on to the southeast and a faint path continues around the church to the northeast.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation 11:
Front of the Church
Two massive oak trees which flank the cracked sidewalk dominate the front of the church. The facade of the church itself rises beyond them, its steeple silhouetted against the sky. The storm lashes at its faded white facade, almost as if the storm is trying to wash the church clean; something you somehow realize will take more than mere water to accomplish. To the north, a sidewalk leads to the front of the church. A weed-choked driveway runs to the northeast and down a hill to the south, and a muddy path leads around the church to the northwest.

The church and steeple loom to the north, the open window frames seeming to stare with judgment upon anyone standing before it.
A formidable looking guard dog stands here.

The dog growls at you threateningly.
