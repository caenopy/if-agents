You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Input: An instruction to play the game.

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start the interactive fiction game by taking the initial action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'. If the game ends or I die, I will use my experience to make a better choice in the next iteration.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
What was that?

You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.

"No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind."

After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.

Rickety Fence
The ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other. Although it hasn't fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and if that egg isn't careful...

The footpath running along the fence veers sharply north.

The egg hums a little tune your mother used to sing at bedtime. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[ask egg about graffiti], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 2: I will ask the egg about the graffiti to gather more information before deciding which direction to go.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[ask egg about graffiti]

Observation 2: The egg scrutinizes you over the top of his spectacles. "You must be new in town; I thought everyone had heard: Mother Loose has disappeared! A most unfortunate incident." He glances furtively all around before motioning you to step closer. "The circumstances were quite baffling; one can't help but speculate. Can you keep a secret?" Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[yes], InteractiveFictionGame[ask egg about graffiti], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 3: I will respond with "yes" to keep the secret and ask the egg about the graffiti for more information.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[yes]

Observation 3: The egg leans forward and almost tumbles off the fence, but recovers just in time. "Shhh! Don't breathe a word. She's been kidnapped by terrorists. The authorities want to avoid a panic, of course, but rumors are flying." Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 4: I will head north towards the grove of trees to investigate the kidnapping of Mother Loose based on the information provided by the egg.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 4:
Bravely, the egg calls after you: "My life is in your hands! I trust you will return shortly to rescue me!"

Forest
The sun has disappeared. Only a narrow north-south passage winds through the forest here; trees and gnarled undergrowth barricade all other exits. Chill air seeps up from the ground and coils around your body, reaching down your neck with insistent, clammy fingers. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 5: I will continue north to investigate the kidnapping of Mother Loose further.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 5:
Deep Forest
Wet branches slap your face, their icy needles stinging. Dense underbrush creeps in from all sides. With each step, mud oozes into your shoes. Insects drop from above and crawl through your hair; knuckles scrape against rough bark. The path hooks from south to southwest here, slithering between the trees like a snake. Faint rustling sounds catch your ear, but when you turn to look, all is still and quiet.

At your feet, a green and yellow basket lies on its side. Whoever dropped it must have been in a hurry, because the contents have spilled out and are strewn everywhere.

An iron pot has come to rest at the edge of the footpath, near a tree.

You can also see a cracked porcelain dish and a bent spoon here.

Thought 7: I will look inside the pot to see if it contains any clues related to Mother Loose's kidnapping.

Thought 9: I will examine the needles to see if there's anything unusual or out of place that could have caused the rustling sounds.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[examine needles]

Observation 9:
Crawling with insects, a living mesh of plant life and death accompanies the path through the forest. Anything not already black with decay shows signs of having been gnawed.

Suddenly, from the corner of your eye, you glimpse a streak of moth-eaten fur hurtling toward you from the forest! Your heart races, yet you stand paralyzed with fear; your mind screams at your unresponsive body to flee. Run! Run for your life!

Too late. Alas, too late.

"Boo!" snarls a big, bad wolf, who is huffing and puffing from all the exertion. His eyes narrow into slits as he studies you closely. "Hey, wait just a minute! You ain't Little Red Riding Hood."

The wolf loiters in the area, keeping an eye on you.

Thought 11: It seems that I cannot give the wolf the basket, dish, spoon, and pot as they are not present in my inventory. I should focus on finding a way to distract the wolf or gather more information about Mother Loose's kidnapping.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation 11: Forest Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

"Don't go!" pleads the egg. "The forest is full of loathsome beasts. You'd be much happier here with me. Really, you would."

Forest Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 15: I will consider the egg's warning and weigh the risks before deciding whether to continue investigating the kidnapping or stay with the egg for safety.
