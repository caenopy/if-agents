You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Input: An instruction to play the game.

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start the interactive fiction game by taking the initial action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'. If the game ends or I die, I will use my experience to make a better choice in the next iteration.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
The faces of the council members look grim. Gilgern continues to speak. 
"Of course, something must be done soon," he says in that gruff, hearty voice you have come to dislike so much. "Must restore public confidence and encourage the return of people to the land. Can't just leave the place to the likes of dragons and trolls. We must all make money again. Isn't as though it's just arrived, dragon's been there for years. Just that people found out about it, that's all." 
Marzipam looks round nervously at the others in the so-called Council of the Wise. 
"Of course, we can't afford to pay you much. We are just poor men ourselves. Think of this more as a civic duty..." he wheezes. 
Around you the other travellers and adventurers shift nervously. 
Gilgern hurriedly adjusts his glasses and glances down at the scroll in front of him. "Says here that the Great Worm can be beaten," he goes on. "Sword of Erondil is the only weapon which can penetrate a dragon's scaly hide. Enchanted weapon, you see. Last seen many years ago in the Castle of Abercorn. Big, ugly place. Near the sea, I think, if memory serves me right. Dragon must be getting a bit careless and lazy by now. Been there all that time. Stands to reason. Might get in a lucky hit or something." 
Marzipam breaks in. "Or there's the spell, I suppose. The dragon is supposed to be held in place under an old enchantment, though that's perhaps just an old tale. Break the spell and the dragon will leave, the story goes..." 
"Well, which of you is interested?" Gilgern looks across at you and the other adventurers. You begin to wish you had never set foot in the town - it just happened to be on your journey, that's all. You've no wish to tangle with dangerous dragons or anything else. 
As Gilgern looks down, you suddenly find that the other adventurers have all quietly taken a couple of steps back, leaving you out in the front. 
"Splendid", chortles Gilgern before you can say anything, "We've one brave soul willing to risk their all for our little cause. Welcome, stranger..." 
Before you know it, you have been whisked away from the town square in a donkey and cart and deposited beside a track. 
"Good luck - you'll need it!" calls the driver over his shoulder, as he hurries away. 

Welcome to Dragon Adventure. You start your quest on a mountain path in the North-East...

Dragon Adventure
A simple text adventure for players aged 9 and over, by William Stott
Release 2 / Serial number 040211 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 

Rocky Mountains
It is a clear, bright morning and all seems peaceful. A tiny sparrowhawk wheels and soars lazily in the cool empty air above. There is a steep pathway to the south leading down into dense woodland, and you can make out an old building by the path. In the distance you can just glimpse the steel-grey of the sea, far away to the west. 

You can go north, south, east or west. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[yes], InteractiveFictionGame[rescue], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Thought 2: Based on the observation, I will explore the area by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[south]' to check out the old building and the surrounding woodland. If I find any useful information or items there, I will use them to help me in my quest to defeat the dragon. If I encounter any challenges or obstacles, I will try to think of creative solutions or use any items or abilities I have acquired. If I feel stuck, I will consider going north to explore other areas or seeking help from other characters in the game.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation 2:
Abandoned Inn
An old, thatched building stands near the path. It seems to be an abandoned inn or tavern, as a faded sign reads 'Troll's Arms'. The walls are a dirty white and the paintwork is starting to peel and blister. The windows are covered in cobwebs and there is the faint odour of mildew and decay. Weeds grow between the flagstones of the path leading up to the door, which leans open. No-one seems to have lived here for years. A path leads north into the mountains and there seems to be some swampy ground to the west. 

You can go north (to the mountains), west (towards a swamp) or east (into the inn). Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[yes], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[rescue], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 3: Based on the observation, I will explore the abandoned inn to see if there is anything useful inside. I will take the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[east]' to enter the inn and search for any items or clues that may help me in my quest to defeat the dragon.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 3:
Inside the Inn
There are a few patches of mould on the walls and the floorboards creak slightly, but the building seems safe enough. As you move you disturb a thin layer of dust. There are some stone steps leading down, and an open doorway to the outside to the west. You see some tables and chairs. There is a dark, intricately-carved wooden chair in the corner behind you. 

You can go west (back outside) or down some steps.

You can see a magnificently carved chair here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[yes], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[rescue], InteractiveFictionGame[get in sofa], InteractiveFictionGame[get in chair], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[push chair to goblin], InteractiveFictionGame[push chair to sofa]
