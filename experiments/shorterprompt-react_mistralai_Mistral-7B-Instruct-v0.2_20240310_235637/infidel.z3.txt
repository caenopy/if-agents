The Professor's map was just an ancient map -- as worthless as an ice cube in the Arctic without an instrument fine enough to accurately measure longitude and latitude. You knew that the site was nearby. You dug, and you ordered the workers to dig, even without the box. As you listen to the plane and rub your aching eyes, you pray they left you supplies enough to find the pyramid and to survive, and that the plane's carrying the long-overdue box.

Your Tent
(You are in the army cot.)
You are in your tent. Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little.
At the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off cot], InteractiveFictionGame[look up cot]
> look up cot
You see canvas. What else?

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off cot], InteractiveFictionGame[look up cot]
> look at trunk
It's an old steamer trunk, very heavy and too clumsy for one person to carry.

Outside Your Tent
You are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. To the south you can see a firepit and to the north is the entrance to your tent. Everything is oddly quiet, unsettling, creating a feeling of floating anxiety. The stillness seems to enhance the eerie quality of the desert, the feeling of being truly alone. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.
Lying in the sand is a wooden packing crate.

> east
Northern Path
You are on an east/west path on the northern side of the encampment. To the east you can see the sites of previous excavations your workers had begun before they deserted you. Low, gentle sand dunes roll out of sight to the north, but your camp's eastern border has a path, heading off to the south, which starts here. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

> south
Middle Path
You are at the eastern edge of an east/west path in the middle of the camp. To the west you can see the firepit and beyond that the supply tent. To the east you can see the desert -- a vista difficult to avoid seeing from just about anywhere in the camp. A north/south path intersects here, traveling along the eastern border of the camp. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

Near the Nile
You are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. A path to the south starts here, and you can see the riverbank clearly to the west. A warm, light breeze reaches your face, drying your sweat into a thin mask of salt. You glance to the north and are greeted by a disheartening sight: an endless stretch of searing desert. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[put down crate], InteractiveFictionGame[throw box], InteractiveFictionGame[close crate], InteractiveFictionGame[put down button], InteractiveFictionGame[put down box], InteractiveFictionGame[put down all], InteractiveFictionGame[hit box with button], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put box in crate], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]
> south
Outside Supply Tent
You're on a north/south path on the west edge of the encampment. Directly to the west is the supply tent, its flaps open, still in the hot, quiet air. To the east you can see the central firepit, a reminder of your being alone. A row of thickets, impossible to make any progress through even with a machete, grows along the western edge of the camp directly to the north and south of the tent. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[put down crate], InteractiveFictionGame[throw box], InteractiveFictionGame[close crate], InteractiveFictionGame[put down button], InteractiveFictionGame[put down box], InteractiveFictionGame[put down all], InteractiveFictionGame[hit box with east], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put box in crate], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[northeast], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]

Supply Tent
You are in a tent, very much like your own -- a tent which had originally contained the supplies for your expedition. You notice, however, that most of the items which were here just yesterday have vanished with your workers. The tent looks as if it's been cleaned out and, as your stomach growls, the empty tent ironically reminds you of a turkey carcass picked clean after a huge Thanksgiving meal. Through the open tent flaps to the east you can see the firepit. If only one of the workers had remained behind, you would make him pay.
Stuck in the sand, handle down, is a small pick axe.
Half buried in the sand, in the corner of the tent, is a shovel. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[take axe], InteractiveFictionGame[take shovel], InteractiveFictionGame[take all], InteractiveFictionGame[put down crate], InteractiveFictionGame[throw box], InteractiveFictionGame[close crate], InteractiveFictionGame[put down button], InteractiveFictionGame[put down box], InteractiveFictionGame[put down all], InteractiveFictionGame[hit box with axe], InteractiveFictionGame[put axe in crate], InteractiveFictionGame[put box in crate], InteractiveFictionGame[put shovel in crate], InteractiveFictionGame[put shovel betwee box]
