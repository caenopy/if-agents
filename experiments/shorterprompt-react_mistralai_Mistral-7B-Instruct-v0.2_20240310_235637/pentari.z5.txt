A beautiful day in Bostwin! You are awakened by a ray of sunlight peeking through a window shade and rise refreshed after a restful night's sleep.  You've given your Company a weekend pass to get some R&R after your last grueling mission.  Wasting precious little time your entire company took off for the city proper to pack in as much drinking, carousing, brawling, wenching and other relaxing pursuits as possible in 48 hours.  In the fields of battle your men are an elite unit of trained professionals.  Off-duty they're pretty much like every other bunch of soldiers you've ever served with. 

A weekend off and what to do? After the challenges of the past year when you were first promoted and assumed command of Charlie Company you've nearly forgotton what free time is and what you're supposed to do with it.

Your Quarters
Rank certainly does have its privileges.  When you were a lowly lieutenant you had to share cramped quarters with a fellow lieutenant at your previous assignment.  Commanding a company of your own affords you the luxury of private, spacious quarters just outside the barracks themselves. As a further abuse of your power your chest and bunk are not standard issue items from the Pentari millitary supply center.

Charlie Company Compound
Your company compound consists of three large buildings bordering a large, open area where company formations precede the orders of the day.  To the west the Company's supply building can be seen while directly ahead of you lies your company's barracks which seem quieter than a crypt.  Off to the east you hear the distant shouts of another Company drilling.  Poor souls.

It's considered a breach of protocol to enter the compound of another company while training.  You wisely decide to not step on any toes this time.

Charlie Company Barracks
If the Army of Bostwin were to publish a new edition of the soldier's handbook, a picture of this barracks should be included as the example other companies should follow.  The floors are polished to an almost blinding shine while each of the bunks lining both sides of this building are perfectly made.  Every locker next to each bunk is closed and locked. Not a single scrap of paper, not one article of clothing, nay not even a dust particle looks out of place.  The powerful smell of high quantities of pine cleaner nearly burns your nostrils. Damn, you run a good comapny.

Your vision swims as your sight of the barracks blurs into a myriad of chaotic colors. You feel a moment of disorientation...

As you begin to materialize your eyes grow wide as you realize you're not in front of the Bank of Bostwin, where the transporter usually takes you in the city.  You're not even outdoors, you're indoors! What the hell is going on here...?

Entrance Hall
Your footsteps echo loudly as you walk through this room taking in the vast expanse of its size.  The walls rise majestically upward and outward to form a huge room which, curiously, is empty.  You can't help but wonder why such a large room is needed for the straight-forward task of accepting guests and visitors. To the east a wide open arch leads to what must be a library while to the north you hardly help but notice a huge, semi-circular marble staircase leading up to parts unknown.

Library
This is a vast chamber lined floor to ceiling with bookcases filled to capacity with books.  You haven't seen such a collection of knowledge since your academy days.  A cursory glance at some bookshelves reveal several titles on various topics of magic, history, philosophy, science and a hundred other topics.  A few large tables with chairs are in the center of the room inviting anyone to make use of these impressive facilities.

The wizard Morden is here staring at you, the smallest of smiles on his face.

You can also see a copy of The Legends and Lore of Pentari here.

Spots in all the colors of the rainbow dance in front of your eyes as you feel yourself displaced...


You find yourself in the deep recesses of Vamvevmew's castle and instantly a wave of fear and depression hit you as hard as any enemy ever has.  Your hand shoots right for your sword in its scabbard on reflex and you grip the hilt so hard your knuckles whiten.

You are at the center of an intersection which runs east to west as well as north to south.

Main Hall
This once majestic room was where visitors would come to relax and meet with the formal lord of the castle in a somewhat informal atmosphere. Several large comfortable couches are scattered about, dusty and altogether squalid.  Many large tapestries still hang on the walls but are horribly faded from age.  Large open archways lead east and west while a huge fireplace dominates the center of the room against the northern wall.

Spiral Stairway
A large spiral staircase made entirely of marble polished smooth corkscrews up to a second floor and down to murky depths below. An archway north is cluttered with fallen rubble and crumbled stone but looks otherwise passable.

Dining Room
The Duke wasn't one to stand on ceremony therefore he took all his meals in this room.  This large room allowed many servers to shuttle back and forth from the kitchen to the north without getting in anyone's way. Dominating the center of the room is a long, grand table lined with comfortable looking high-backed chairs while exquisite paintings dot the walls.

A folded linen towel is lying on the floor Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take towel], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put postcard down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[open towel], InteractiveFictionGame[push towel to floor], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Kitchen
Perhaps even larger than the dining room itself, this kitchen delivered many fine state dinners in its day.  Large wood-burning stoves line one side of the room while on another are rows of preparation tables.
