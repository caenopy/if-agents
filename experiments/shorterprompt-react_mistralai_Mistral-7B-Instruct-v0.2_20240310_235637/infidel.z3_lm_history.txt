You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Input: An instruction to play the game.

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start the interactive fiction game by taking the initial action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'. If the game ends or I die, I will use my experience to make a better choice in the next iteration.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
The Professor's map was just an ancient map -- as worthless as an ice cube in the Arctic without an instrument fine enough to accurately measure longitude and latitude. You knew that the site was nearby. You dug, and you ordered the workers to dig, even without the box. As you listen to the plane and rub your aching eyes, you pray they left you supplies enough to find the pyramid and to survive, and that the plane's carrying the long-overdue box.

I could try to find more information about the trunk or the area around the campsite, or I could try to explore other areas of the game to see if I can find any clues that might help me progress. Ultimately, I will need to use my problem-solving skills and logical reasoning to figure out how to open the trunk and continue the game.

Action 25: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation 25:
Outside Your Tent
You are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. To the south you can see a firepit and to the north is the entrance to your tent. Everything is oddly quiet, unsettling, creating a feeling of floating anxiety. The stillness seems to enhance the eerie quality of the desert, the feeling of being truly alone. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.
Lying in the sand is a wooden packing crate. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[take crate], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[open crate], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[northeast], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]

Action 29: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 29:
Northern Path
You are on an east/west path on the northern side of the encampment. To the east you can see the sites of previous excavations your workers had begun before they deserted you. Low, gentle sand dunes roll out of sight to the north, but your camp's eastern border has a path, heading off to the south, which starts here.

Action 30: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation 30:
Middle Path
You are at the eastern edge of an east/west path in the middle of the camp. To the west you can see the firepit and beyond that the supply tent. To the east you can see the desert -- a vista difficult to avoid seeing from just about anywhere in the camp. A north/south path intersects here, traveling along the eastern border of the camp. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[throw box], InteractiveFictionGame[put down crate], InteractiveFictionGame[close crate], InteractiveFictionGame[put down box], InteractiveFictionGame[put down button], InteractiveFictionGame[put down all], InteractiveFictionGame[hit box with crate], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put box in crate], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[northwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[northeast], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]

Action 33: InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Observation 33:
Near the Nile
You are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. A path to the south starts here, and you can see the riverbank clearly to the west. A warm, light breeze reaches your face, drying your sweat into a thin mask of salt. You glance to the north and are greeted by a disheartening sight: an endless stretch of searing desert. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[put down crate], InteractiveFictionGame[throw box], InteractiveFictionGame[close crate], InteractiveFictionGame[put down button], InteractiveFictionGame[put down box], InteractiveFictionGame[put down all], InteractiveFictionGame[hit box with button], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put box in crate], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]

Action 34: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation 34:
Outside Supply Tent
You're on a north/south path on the west edge of the encampment. Directly to the west is the supply tent, its flaps open, still in the hot, quiet air. To the east you can see the central firepit, a reminder of your being alone. A row of thickets, impossible to make any progress through even with a machete, grows along the western edge of the camp directly to the north and south of the tent. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[put down crate], InteractiveFictionGame[throw box], InteractiveFictionGame[close crate], InteractiveFictionGame[put down button], InteractiveFictionGame[put down box], InteractiveFictionGame[put down all], InteractiveFictionGame[hit box with east], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put box in crate], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[northeast], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]

Thought 35: I will explore the supply tent to the west to see if there are any clues or items that might help me progress in the game.

Action 35: InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Observation 35:
Supply Tent
You are in a tent, very much like your own -- a tent which had originally contained the supplies for your expedition. You notice, however, that most of the items which were here just yesterday have vanished with your workers. The tent looks as if it's been cleaned out and, as your stomach growls, the empty tent ironically reminds you of a turkey carcass picked clean after a huge Thanksgiving meal. Through the open tent flaps to the east you can see the firepit. If only one of the workers had remained behind, you would make him pay.
Stuck in the sand, handle down, is a small pick axe.
Half buried in the sand, in the corner of the tent, is a shovel. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[take axe], InteractiveFictionGame[take shovel], InteractiveFictionGame[take all], InteractiveFictionGame[put down crate], InteractiveFictionGame[throw box], InteractiveFictionGame[close crate], InteractiveFictionGame[put down button], InteractiveFictionGame[put down box], InteractiveFictionGame[put down all], InteractiveFictionGame[hit box with axe], InteractiveFictionGame[put axe in crate], InteractiveFictionGame[put box in crate], InteractiveFictionGame[put shovel in crate], InteractiveFictionGame[put shovel betwee box]

Thought 37: With the shovel in hand, I will now continue my excavation attempts to find the pyramid and progress in the game. I will explore the area around the campsite and use the shovel to dig up any potential clues or items that might help me. I will also keep an eye out for any other objects or areas that seem relevant and interact with them using the available actions.

Observation 46:
Supply Tent
You are in a tent, very much like your own -- a tent which had originally contained the supplies for your expedition. You notice, however, that most of the items which were here just yesterday have vanished with your workers. The tent looks as if it's been cleaned out and, as your stomach growls, the empty tent ironically reminds you of a turkey carcass picked clean after a huge Thanksgiving meal. Through the open tent flaps to the east you can see the firepit. If only one of the workers had remained behind, you would make him pay.
Stuck in the sand, handle down, is a small pick axe.
