You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start the game by taking the initial action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'. If the game ends or I die, I will use my experience to make a better choice in the next iteration.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you."

"What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly.

"Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages."

"And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully.

"A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever.

"But what of Kolchack the --"

"Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!"  He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!"

And with that, you embark on...

Zork: The Undiscovered Underground, a text adventure prequel to Zork Grand Inquisitor
Copyright 1997 by Activision Inc.
Written by Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, programmed by Gerry Kevin Wilson.
Release 16 / Serial number 970828 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/2
Standard interpreter 1.0

New Excavation
You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take into tunnel], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought 2: I will take the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[take into tunnel]' to enter the tunnel and explore the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[take into tunnel]

Observation 2:
As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!

Tunnel
You are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought 3: I will take the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[east]' to explore further in the tunnel and find a way out of the trapped area.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 3:
Cultural Complex
This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period."  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription "Convention Center."  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science." Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Thought 4: I will explore further by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[east]' to enter the Royal Theater and gather more information about the area.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 4:
Theater
This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 5: I will explore further by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[north]' to investigate the oversized stage and potentially find clues or hidden areas.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 5:
Seating Area
You are in an expansive area, surrounded by large, throne-like seats. Aisles lead in just about every direction. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought 6: I will explore further by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[search seats]' to check if there are any hidden clues or items on the seats.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[search seats]

Observation 6: You find nothing of interest. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought 7: I will explore further by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[search aisles]' to check if there are any hidden clues or items in the aisles.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[search aisles]

Observation 7: You can't see any such thing. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought 8: I will explore further by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[west]' to return to the Cultural Complex and check if there are any other areas or clues that I may have missed.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Observation 8: Didn't you believe me? Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought 9: I must have misunderstood the previous observation. I will explore further by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[north]' to investigate the "Convention Center" mentioned in the Cultural Complex.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 9: I rarely make recommendations that are ill-informed. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought 10: I apologize for the misunderstanding in my previous observation. I will explore further by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[south]' to return to the Theater and continue my exploration from there.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation 10: You know, I've been in enough of these adventures to know a thing or two. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought 11: Based on the observations, it seems that there are no hidden clues or items in the current location. I suggest taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[west]' to return to the Cultural Complex and explore other areas or clues that may have been missed earlier.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Observation 11: And I'm not beyond a good `I told you so.' Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought 12: I acknowledge the previous observation and will continue exploring the Cultural Complex by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[search for hidden clues or items]' in various areas to ensure that no important details are missed.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[search for hidden clues or items]

Observation 12: You can't see any such thing. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Action 13: InteractiveFictionGame[explore other areas in the Cultural Complex]
