You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start the game by taking the initial action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'. If the game ends or I die, I will use my experience to make a better choice in the next iteration.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.

Standard interpreter 1.0

Void
You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 2: I will explore the environment by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[north]'.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 2:
You move, or rather you come to a new place. The concept of body and movement seems different here.

Void
This new location is not much different from the one you came from. The shadows are still moving around at random through the abyss, reverberating with strange sounds and coloured light.

A cascade of red colour explodes below you. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 3: I will explore further north to see if I can find any clues or patterns in the environment.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 3:
Void
This new location is not much different from the one you came from. The shadows are still moving around at random through the abyss, reverberating with strange sounds and coloured light.

Suddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[examine shadow], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 4: I will examine the shadow to gather more information about it before making a decision on whether to explore further north or not.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[examine shadow]

Observation 4:
In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.

The shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.

Roof
The city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star-filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take railing], InteractiveFictionGame[down]

Thought 5: I will examine the surroundings of the roof more closely by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[take railing]' to get a better understanding of the environment and potentially find any hidden clues or objects.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[take railing]

Observation 5: The railing won't budge, but one of the statues breaks of in your hands. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue down]

Thought 6: I will explore the interior of the tower by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[down]'.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[down]

Observation 6:
The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.

Study
Dust and spider webs cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam, blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic, dreamy forms. The walls are lined with bookshelves and a lone desk lies at one corner. Close to a staircase, which leads further up and down the tower, is a massive table made of black stone. A doorway leads to a smaller room to the south.

On the desk is a yellow paper. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[examine writing], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue down], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on webs], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on bookshelves], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on desk], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on table], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on ink], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 7: I will examine the yellow paper on the desk to gather any information it may contain.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[take paper]

Observation 7: Taken. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[examine writing], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[put paper down], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[put paper on webs], InteractiveFictionGame[put paper on bookshelves], InteractiveFictionGame[put paper on desk], InteractiveFictionGame[put paper on table], InteractiveFictionGame[put paper on ink], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on webs], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on bookshelves], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on desk], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on table], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on ink], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on webs], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on bookshelves], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on desk], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on table], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on ink], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 8: I will examine the writing on the yellow paper to gain any useful information it may provide.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[examine writing]

Observation 8:
It seems to be a poem, or chant. The language is unfamiliar and complicated, and you repeat the syllables with a low voice: Y'ai'ng'ngah h'ee-l'geb f'ai throdog.

Even as you speak you sense something approaching. The light in the room darkens, and a mysterious green glow is emitted from some dust on the stone table. Its brightness intensifies to an unbearable level and you involuntarily step away. A shape appears on the previously empty table. As the flash fades away you recognise the shape as that of a man, lying still on the table.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.] Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[touch body], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[put paper down], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[put paper on table], InteractiveFictionGame[put paper on webs], InteractiveFictionGame[put paper on bookshelves], InteractiveFictionGame[put paper on desk], InteractiveFictionGame[put paper on ink], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on table], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on webs], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on bookshelves], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on desk], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on ink], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on table], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on webs], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on bookshelves], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on desk], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on ink], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 9: I will approach the man on the table and examine him to gather any information that may help me understand the situation.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[touch body]

Observation 9: After several attempts, you manage to shake the man awake. He sits up on the table, still confused. In response to your many questions the man simply states that he can't remember and it seems that he is suffering from amnesia.

Thought 10: I will examine the volumes on the bookshelves to see if they contain any useful information or clues that may help us figure out the man's identity or the situation we are in.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[examine volumes]

Observation 10:
You browse through the library but can't find any books written in a language you can read, so you leave them alone.

The man gets up from the table and looks around, perplexed. 'I think I've been here before', he mutters.

Thought 11: I will explore the smaller room to the south to see if it contains any useful information or clues that may help us figure out the man's identity or the situation we are in.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation 11:
Storage
This is a minor storage chamber, connected to the study through a doorway in the northern wall. There are some shelves, mostly vacant, here.

On one of the shelves are four small vials, each neatly labelled and containing some green powder. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[examine vial], InteractiveFictionGame[take vial], InteractiveFictionGame[put paper down], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[take all off shelves], InteractiveFictionGame[put paper on shelves], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on shelves], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on shelves]

Thought 12: I will examine the labels on the vials to gather any information they may provide.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[examine vial]

Observation 12:
The vials do not have any distinguishing features, apart from their labels, which are written in an incomprehensible arabesque alphabet. They all contain a peculiar green powder.

From the other room you can hear the voice of the man on the table calling you back. You return to the study and he says: 'Some parts of my memory have come back now. I remember that my name is Charles Bristow and I studied archeology and history in New England. Something terrible happened but of that I can recall only small fragments.' He looks around the chamber and says with despair in his voice, 'My God, where am I? Will my nightmares never end?'

Thought 13: I will try to help Charles remember more about his past and figure out where we are. I will ask him about his studies in New England and see if that brings back any memories.

Action 13: InteractiveFictionGame[ask about studies in New England]
