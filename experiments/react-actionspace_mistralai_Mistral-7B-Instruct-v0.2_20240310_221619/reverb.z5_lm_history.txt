You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start the game by taking the initial action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'. If the game ends or I die, I will use my experience to make a better choice in the next iteration.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice.

Anyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new "Surfers Monthly" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening.

Shyeah, right. That's what YOU think.

Behind the Counter
You are behind the counter at "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor", where you are currently working. Not much of a job, but it keeps you from going broke during the nine months of the year when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing instructor. The rest of the parlor is southwest.

There is something pressing that you think you have to do, but you can't think what it might be. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[get up], InteractiveFictionGame[examine counter], InteractiveFictionGame[take note], InteractiveFictionGame[take box], InteractiveFictionGame[examine note], InteractiveFictionGame[leave note], InteractiveFictionGame[open box], InteractiveFictionGame[push note to southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[push box to southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[push note to counter], InteractiveFictionGame[push box to counter]

Thought 2: I will examine the counter to check if there's anything unusual or important there.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[examine counter]

Observation 2: It's a majorly boring counter which you're unfortunately very familiar with.  Hey, maybe that handwritten note lying next to a pizza box on the counter is related to whatever it is you're supposed to be doing now. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[get up], InteractiveFictionGame[take note], InteractiveFictionGame[take box], InteractiveFictionGame[examine note], InteractiveFictionGame[open box], InteractiveFictionGame[push note to southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[push box to southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[take all off counter], InteractiveFictionGame[push note to counter], InteractiveFictionGame[push box to counter]

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[examine note]

Observation 3:
The note reads:

"Stanley,
    Don't forget to make your delivery to Mr. Calzone, located at the San Doppleton Courthouse. You're already on thin ice, kid. One more screwup and you can expect to be looking for a new job."

The note is signed with the initials "RT". The paper is official "Mr. Tasty's" stationery with the name Bob "Tasty" Tasker and lots of balloons and smiley faces all over the border. Isn't that cute? Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[get up], InteractiveFictionGame[take note], InteractiveFictionGame[take box], InteractiveFictionGame[examine note], InteractiveFictionGame[open box], InteractiveFictionGame[push note to southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[push box to southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[take all off counter], InteractiveFictionGame[push note to counter], InteractiveFictionGame[push box to counter]

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[get up]

Observation 4:
Pizza Parlor
You are standing in the middle of "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor". The counter separating you from the back of the parlor stretches in front of you on the northeast corner of the room. To the south is an exit to the street.

On the counter are a handwritten note and a large pizza box (which is closed).

Thought 6: I will go to Mr. Calzone's location at the San Doppleton Courthouse to make the delivery as instructed in the note.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation 6:
Street, by Pizza Parlor
San Doppleton is where you live, work and play -- at least until summer. It has the typical California culture; which is to say, none. But at least it's just forty minutes' drive from Santa Barbara and the beach, so you can't complain much.

You stand in the heart of San Doppleton's main drag, the business district. The street goes east and west. The sidewalk runs by a pizza parlor, with a sewer vent nearby.

A man and a woman walk by holding hands. They make a cute couple.
