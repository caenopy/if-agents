Sitting Room
This is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food. That is a good room.

Even though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of "no"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.

Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[push pet], InteractiveFictionGame[kiss on pet], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Food Room
Food room, glorious food room!

Your bowl for food and water is here, but that's only the beginning. There's also a lot of secret places where your pet keeps food and things that go with food and things that make food better. There's a thing that gets hot and a box that stays cold, and that is your favorite because you know there is always food inside there. A cloth hangs down from the door of the cold box. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[open box], InteractiveFictionGame[open all], InteractiveFictionGame[east]

This is a good trick!

You pull on the cloth with your teeth and back up as the door opens. Inside you can see various leftovers, some jars, some sandwich fixings and one shiny can.

The cold box hums softly. It must be happy because it has a lot of food inside it. That always makes you happy.

Right now it's open and blasting you with cold air. Inside you can see various leftovers, some jars and some sandwich fixings.

Sometimes your pet makes something and saves some of it in the cold box to see how long it takes to grow fuzzy stuff on it. It's an interesting experiment, but not much good to you when you are hungry.
