You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start the game by taking the initial action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'. If the game ends or I die, I will use my experience to make a better choice in the next iteration.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
No, not a prison, though stone stands around you, as expressionless as a mirror awaiting face and form; and in the silence you hear no plaint of flute or roar of gong, but instead the crash of porcelain shattering. 


The Moonlit Tower
Interactive Fiction, v.1.0 
Yoon Ha Lee, copyright 2002 
Newcomers may want to type HELP or ABOUT.
Release 1 / Serial number 020927 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 

Moonlit Chamber
Moonlight diffuses through the walls, tracing out unreadable sigils in calligraphies of light and dark. Stairs adorned with bas-relief motifs spiral downward.

You can see a porcelain mask here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take egg], InteractiveFictionGame[take mask], InteractiveFictionGame[get in stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[take all], InteractiveFictionGame[push mask to stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[down]

Thought 2: I will take the porcelain mask as it might be useful later.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[take mask]

Observation 2: Taken. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take egg], InteractiveFictionGame[get in stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[down]

Thought 3: I will go down the stairs to explore further.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[down]

Observation 3:
Shadow Armory
Shadows gather around you. For a moment, dregs of light defined by the negative space take on the shapes of maple leaf, kite, comb, and other shapes that flicker across the walls too rapidly for you to interpret.

Curiously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.

Northward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take dagger], InteractiveFictionGame[get in stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[push dagger to stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 4: I will explore the passageways to the north and west to see what I can find.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Observation 4:
The shapes of light you saw as you entered fade irrevocably.


Silent Symphony
A single bronze gong hangs from its wooden frame in the room's center. There are also silk cushions arranged around the floor in a court ensemble's traditional half-circle, but no bamboo flutes or clay ocarinas, nine-stringed zithers or singers' unfolding fans, are in evidence. A mural that touches each wall in turn gives the room an illusion of greater depth. 

Two entrances, one east, one north; the former is wrapped in shadow, the latter in light. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[get in cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[look in cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on cushions]

Thought 5: I will explore the entrance to the east as it is currently in light and might lead to new discoveries.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 5:
Shadow Armory
Curiously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.

Northward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take dagger], InteractiveFictionGame[get in stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[push dagger to stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 6: I have already explored this room earlier, so I will go back to the room with the silk cushions and explore the entrance to the north instead.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 6:
Undying Garden
Barren branches and pines suggest winter's quiet. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.

A jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, between translucence and opacity, curve and line, and other dichotomies too subtle for your eye. A gentle warmth from the surface invites touch.

Transactions of light show other rooms southward and westward.

You can see a tortoise-shell comb here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take comb], InteractiveFictionGame[turn compass], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[take other with comb], InteractiveFictionGame[hit comb], InteractiveFictionGame[turn compass to swallow], InteractiveFictionGame[turn compass to hawk], InteractiveFictionGame[turn compass to crane], InteractiveFictionGame[push comb to compass], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on compass], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Thought 7: I will take the jade compass as it might be a useful item in the game.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[take compass]

Observation 7: The jade compass already has a place in the world's reckoning. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take comb], InteractiveFictionGame[turn compass], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[take other with comb], InteractiveFictionGame[hit comb], InteractiveFictionGame[turn compass to swallow], InteractiveFictionGame[turn compass to hawk], InteractiveFictionGame[turn compass to crane], InteractiveFictionGame[push comb to compass], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on compass], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Thought 8: I have already explored the rooms to the south and west, so I will explore the room to the west where I saw the bronze gong earlier. I might be able to interact with it or find something useful.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Observation 8:
Skeletal Banquet
It seems this is a banquet room, if a banquet had no especial place for people to dine. Glassware and stoneware are arranged in deliberate shapes, as though they are constellations. 

South lies a chamber of brooding silence, and a vague, sweet fragrance comes from the east. Stairs of blackest marble lead downward.

On the table are a banquet of bones and some ivory chopsticks. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take chopsticks], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[get in marble], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[hit bones], InteractiveFictionGame[take all off table], InteractiveFictionGame[push chopsticks to marble], InteractiveFictionGame[push chopsticks to table], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on marble], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on table]

Thought 9: I will explore the room to the east as there is a vague, sweet fragrance coming from that direction. It might lead to something interesting or useful.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 9:
Undying Garden
Barren branches and pines suggest winter's quiet. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.

Thought 10: I have already explored this room earlier, so I will go back to the room with the bronze gong and try to interact with it or find something useful. The compass might help me navigate the rooms better.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Observation 10:
Skeletal Banquet
It seems this is a banquet room, if a banquet had no especial place for people to dine. Glassware and stoneware are arranged in deliberate shapes, as though they are constellations.

Thought 11: I have already explored this room and haven't found anything new or useful, so I will go back to the room with the jade compass and try to use it to navigate to new areas or discover hidden items.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation 11:
Silent Symphony
A single bronze gong hangs from its wooden frame in the room's center. There are also silk cushions arranged around the floor in a court ensemble's traditional half-circle, but no bamboo flutes or clay ocarinas, nine-stringed zithers or singers' unfolding fans, are in evidence. A mural that touches each wall in turn gives the room an illusion of greater depth. 

Two entrances, one east, one north; the former is wrapped in shadow, the latter in light. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[get in cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[look in cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on cushions]

Thought 12: I have already explored the room with the bronze gong, so I will try to use the jade compass to navigate to a new area or discover hidden items. The compass might help me find something useful or lead me to a new room.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[turn compass]

Observation 12: You can't see any such thing. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[get in cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[look in cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on cushions]

Thought 13: I need to figure out how to use the jade compass to navigate or discover hidden items. I will examine the compass more closely and look for any instructions or clues on how to use it effectively.

Action 13: InteractiveFictionGame[look at compass]

Observation 13: You can't see any such thing. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[get in cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[look in cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on cushions]

Thought 14: I need to explore the room further to find instructions or clues on how to use the jade compass effectively. I will examine the mural on the walls and check the silk cushions for any hidden items or messages.

Action 14: InteractiveFictionGame[look at mural]

Observation 14: The mural shows court ladies whispering to each other in a garden; men kneel to float folded-paper poems down the brook for them to read. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[get in cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[look in cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on cushions]

Thought 16: I will take the ocarina as it might be a useful item in the game or provide some clues on how to use the jade compass effectively.

Action 16: InteractiveFictionGame[take ocarina]

Observation 16: You already have that. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[get in cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[put ocarina down], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[put ocarina on cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on cushions]
