You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start the game by taking the initial action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'. If the game ends or I die, I will use my experience to make a better choice in the next iteration.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
A beautiful day in Bostwin! You are awakened by a ray of sunlight peeking through a window shade and rise refreshed after a restful night's sleep.  You've given your Company a weekend pass to get some R&R after your last grueling mission.  Wasting precious little time your entire company took off for the city proper to pack in as much drinking, carousing, brawling, wenching and other relaxing pursuits as possible in 48 hours.  In the fields of battle your men are an elite unit of trained professionals.  Off-duty they're pretty much like every other bunch of soldiers you've ever served with. 

A weekend off and what to do? After the challenges of the past year when you were first promoted and assumed command of Charlie Company you've nearly forgotton what free time is and what you're supposed to do with it.

Your Quarters
Rank certainly does have its privileges.  When you were a lowly lieutenant you had to share cramped quarters with a fellow lieutenant at your previous assignment.  Commanding a company of your own affords you the luxury of private, spacious quarters just outside the barracks themselves. As a further abuse of your power your chest and bunk are not standard issue items from the Pentari millitary supply center.

You can see a postcard here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take postcard], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 2: I will take a look at the postcard before exploring further.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[take postcard]

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[put postcard down]

Observation 3: Dropped. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take postcard], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 4: I will explore the area north of my quarters.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 4:
Charlie Company Compound
Your company compound consists of three large buildings bordering a large, open area where company formations precede the orders of the day.  To the west the Company's supply building can be seen while directly ahead of you lies your company's barracks which seem quieter than a crypt.  Off to the east you hear the distant shouts of another Company drilling.  Poor souls. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Thought 5: I will explore the area to the east where I hear another Company drilling.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 5: It's considered a breach of protocol to enter the compound of another company while training.  You wisely decide to not step on any toes this time. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Thought 6: I will return to my quarters and consider my next move.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Observation 6: Why would you want to inspect the Company's supply cache when you have a whole weekend off? Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Thought 7: I will explore the Company's barracks instead.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 7:
Charlie Company Barracks
If the Army of Bostwin were to publish a new edition of the soldier's handbook, a picture of this barracks should be included as the example other companies should follow.  The floors are polished to an almost blinding shine while each of the bunks lining both sides of this building are perfectly made.  Every locker next to each bunk is closed and locked. Not a single scrap of paper, not one article of clothing, nay not even a dust particle looks out of place.  The powerful smell of high quantities of pine cleaner nearly burns your nostrils. Damn, you run a good comapny.

You can see a Pentarian Transporter here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[enter], InteractiveFictionGame[get in other], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Thought 8: I will approach the Pentarian Transporter and try to enter it.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[enter]

Observation 8: The Charlie Company Barracks (in the Pentarian Transporter) Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[city], InteractiveFictionGame[get up], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down]

Thought 9: I will explore the area inside the Pentarian Transporter.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[city]

Observation 9:
Your vision swims as your sight of the barracks blurs into a myriad of chaotic colors. You feel a moment of disorientation...

As you begin to materialize your eyes grow wide as you realize you're not in front of the Bank of Bostwin, where the transporter usually takes you in the city.  You're not even outdoors, you're indoors! What the hell is going on here...?

Entrance Hall
Your footsteps echo loudly as you walk through this room taking in the vast expanse of its size.  The walls rise majestically upward and outward to form a huge room which, curiously, is empty.  You can't help but wonder why such a large room is needed for the straight-forward task of accepting guests and visitors. To the east a wide open arch leads to what must be a library while to the north you hardly help but notice a huge, semi-circular marble staircase leading up to parts unknown.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.] Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down]

Thought 10: I will explore the library to the east.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 10:
Library
This is a vast chamber lined floor to ceiling with bookcases filled to capacity with books.  You haven't seen such a collection of knowledge since your academy days.  A cursory glance at some bookshelves reveal several titles on various topics of magic, history, philosophy, science and a hundred other topics.  A few large tables with chairs are in the center of the room inviting anyone to make use of these impressive facilities.

The wizard Morden is here staring at you, the smallest of smiles on his face.

You can also see a copy of The Legends and Lore of Pentari here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[covert], InteractiveFictionGame[take other], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[push other to floor], InteractiveFictionGame[west]
