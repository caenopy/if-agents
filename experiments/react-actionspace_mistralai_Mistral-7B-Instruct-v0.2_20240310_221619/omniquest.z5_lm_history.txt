You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start the game by taking the initial action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'. If the game ends or I die, I will use my experience to make a better choice in the next iteration.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
OMNIQuest
A POP Release
Parser Version 1.0
POP RULES!!

There's nothing to do, and you're sort of tired, so you lay on your bed and think philosophical thoughts.
(meaning of life, end of the world, etc.)  As you philosophize, you begin to doze...

You wake up with a horrible headache.  As you glance around, you realize that you are not in Kansas anymore.
You attempt to gain some bearing as to where you are...

Large Clearing
You are standing in a large clearing surrounded by a dense forest.  There is a path to the east.

You can see a tree here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[examine tree], InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Thought 2: I will examine the tree to gather more information about my surroundings before proceeding along the path.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[examine tree]

Observation 2: There is a snorkel hanging from the tree.  You take it. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put snorkel down], InteractiveFictionGame[put on snorkel]

Thought 3: I will put on the snorkel to see if it serves any purpose in this environment.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[put on snorkel]

Observation 3: You put on the snorkel. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off snorkel], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put snorkel down]

Thought 4: I will proceed along the path to the east to explore further.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 4:
Small Path
The path branches here.  There are paths to the west and south that continue into the forest.  The path to the east appears to lead into some rather rocky territory. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off snorkel], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[put snorkel down]

Thought 5: I will explore the rocky terrain to the east and see what I can find.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 5:
Canyon Entrance
This is the entrance to a canyon formed by an ancient river.  The canyon is to the east.  There is a sandy path to the northwest that seems to lead to a beach.  There is a path leading into a forest to the west. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off snorkel], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[get in northwest], InteractiveFictionGame[put snorkel down]

Thought 6: I will explore the canyon to the east and see what I can find.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 6:
Canyon Path
The path here is a riverbed that has long since gone dry.  The river has cut several meandering passages into the canyon, forming what looks like two rather large boulders.  A passage to the north appears to go around the larger boulder, while a narrow gap to the southeast seems to go around the smaller boulder.  A passage to the east cuts the rock into its separate sections.  And of course, the passage to the west goes back the way you came. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off snorkel], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[put snorkel down]

Thought 7: I will explore the narrow gap to the southeast to see if there is anything of interest on the other side.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]

Observation 7:
Small Clearing
This clearing is apparently a brief widening of some ancient river.  There are various small passages winding around two large boulders.  These are to the north, south, and west.

You can see a shovel here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take shovel], InteractiveFictionGame[take off snorkel], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[put snorkel down]

Thought 8: I will take the shovel to add it to my inventory and explore the area further.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[take shovel]

Observation 8: Taken. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off snorkel], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[put shovel down], InteractiveFictionGame[put snorkel down]
