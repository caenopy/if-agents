That, and a feeling that something you never knew you possessed has been lost.\n\nSuddenly, oblivion is split by a blinding light and a crash of sound.

Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The only exit is through the gate to the east.\n\nA church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the graveyard.\n\nA large branch has been broken from one of the trees and has crushed the grave marker below it.
