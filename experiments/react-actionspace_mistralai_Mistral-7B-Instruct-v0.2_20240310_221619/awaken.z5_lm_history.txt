(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start the game by taking the initial action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'. If the game ends or I die, I will use my experience to make a better choice in the next iteration.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
You remember darkness. And the cold. Cold and darkness. And silence. Those memories are all that you have. That, and a feeling that something you never knew you possessed has been lost.

Suddenly, oblivion is split by a blinding light and a crash of sound. You awaken to the roar of a storm and a deluge of rain and mud.

In the Mud
Rain and muddy water are pouring down on you, making it difficult to see or even breathe. Sodden earth and mud surrounds you on all sides except overhead, where flashes of lightning illuminate a storm tossed sky. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[put water under mud], InteractiveFictionGame[put mud under water], InteractiveFictionGame[put sky under water], InteractiveFictionGame[put rain under water], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 2: I will try to get out of the mud and rain to find shelter and possibly find clues about what I have lost. I will first try to go up to see if there is any structure or shelter above me.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Observation 2:
As you scramble out of the hole the mud collapses downward, filling in the hole behind you.

Graveyard
Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The only exit is through the gate to the east.

A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the graveyard.

A large branch has been broken from one of the trees and has crushed the grave marker below it. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take broken], InteractiveFictionGame[take branch], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[push broken to trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put trees under markers], InteractiveFictionGame[put markers under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put east under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put church under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put wind under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put broken under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put windows under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put grave under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put mold under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put branch under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put ground under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put rain under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put steeple under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put ivy under trees]

Thought 3: I will go through the gate to the east and investigate the church for any clues or shelter.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 3:
West Side of the Church
This side of the church is untended and grasses and weeds have run rampant. A muddy trail leads back to the graveyard to the west and on to the southeast and a faint path continues around the church to the northeast.

To the east, the wall of the church breaks some of the force of the wind. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[put east under church], InteractiveFictionGame[put church under east], InteractiveFictionGame[put trail under east], InteractiveFictionGame[put windows under east], InteractiveFictionGame[put southeast under east], InteractiveFictionGame[put wind under east], InteractiveFictionGame[put west under east], InteractiveFictionGame[put mud under east], InteractiveFictionGame[put rain under east], InteractiveFictionGame[put weeds under east], InteractiveFictionGame[put chain under east], InteractiveFictionGame[put northeast under east], InteractiveFictionGame[put steeple under east]

Thought 4: I will investigate the church further by going north to explore the interior of the church for any clues or shelter.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 4:
North Side of the Church
The trees close in here, their storm-tossed branches seeming to reach clawing limbs towards the back of the church. The weeds have run wild here and ivy climbs its way up the back of the building.  A faint path continues around the church to the southeast and the southwest.

The south wall of the church looms blankly overhead.

Lightning arcs overhead, followed instantly by a blast of thunder.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[north]
