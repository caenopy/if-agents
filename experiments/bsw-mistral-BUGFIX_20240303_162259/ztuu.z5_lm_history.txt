History: Begin game:
Observation: It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you." "What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly. "Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages." "And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully. "A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever. "But what of Kolchack the --" "Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!" He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!" And with that, you embark on...

Release 16 / Serial number 970828 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/2 Standard interpreter 1.0 New Excavation You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.
Action:[[ I'll explore the tunnel with the lantern, taking care not to trip or stumble. I'll also keep an eye out for any interesting features or items along the way. (go north and look around)]]

"We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you." "What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly. "Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages." "And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully. "A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms.

He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever. "But what of Kolchack the --" "Enough! Kolchack is contracted.

This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow. Action: I'll explore the tunnel with the lantern, taking care not to trip or stumble. I'll also keep an eye out for any interesting features or items along the way.

Action: I'll follow the sound of the water, keeping my lantern held high to light the way.
