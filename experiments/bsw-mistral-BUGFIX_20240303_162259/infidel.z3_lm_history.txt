History: Begin game:
Observation: The Professor's map was just an ancient map -- as worthless as an ice cube in the Arctic without an instrument fine enough to accurately measure longitude and latitude. You knew that the site was nearby. You dug, and you ordered the workers to dig, even without the box. As you listen to the plane and rub your aching eyes, you pray they left you supplies enough to find the pyramid and to survive, and that the plane's carrying the long-overdue box.

Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little. At the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.
Action:[[ Try to open the trunk. If it's locked, look for a key or a way to pick the lock.]]

Observation: You leave the tent and head north. The sun beats down on you, but the cool breeze feels good. You come across a small stream. Action: I'll fill my canteen from the stream.]]

History: Observation: The Professor's map was just an ancient map -- as worthless as an ice cube in the Arctic without an instrument fine enough to accurately measure longitude and latitude. You knew that the site was nearby. You dug, and you ordered the workers to dig, even without the box. As you listen to the plane and rub your aching eyes, you pray they left you supplies enough to find the pyramid and to survive, and that the plane's carrying the long-overdue box.
