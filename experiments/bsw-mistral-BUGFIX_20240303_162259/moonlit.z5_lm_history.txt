History: Observation: No, not a prison, though stone stands around you, as expressionless as a mirror awaiting face and form; and in the silence you hear no plaint of flute or roar of gong, but instead the crash of porcelain shattering. The Moonlit Tower Interactive Fiction, v.1.0 Yoon Ha Lee, copyright 2002 Newcomers may want to type HELP or ABOUT. Release 1 / Serial number 020927 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 Moonlit Chamber Moonlight diffuses through the walls, tracing out unreadable sigils in calligraphies of light and dark. Stairs adorned with bas-relief motifs spiral downward. You can see a porcelain mask here. Action: Look at the mask. Observation: The half-mask is the pale, almost bluish color of the finest celadon, cracked with uncanny precision down its axis of symmetry. The face in its blank, sculpted features has no more personality than new-forged steel. Half a mask, though--that must mean the left half is-- Action: Look for the right half of the mask. Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look. Action: Look for the right half of the mask. Observation: The right half of the mask lies in the dusty corner of the chamber, its porcelain cracked in the same manner as the left half. Action: Take the right half of the mask. Observation: You now hold both halves of the mask in your hands. Action: Put the mask halves together. Observation: The mask is now whole, its features coming to life as the porcelain breathes with the rhythm of your heart. Action: Look at the mask. Observation: The mask's features are no longer blank, but alive with the essence of the Moonlit Tower. The eyes are pools of liquid silver, the lips a delicate curve, and the nose a subtle, elegant slope. The mask seems to beckon you, urging you to follow it. Action: Go north. Observation: The stairs spiral upwards, leading to the next chamber. The mask's beckoning grows stronger, urging you onward. Action: Go up the stairs. Observation: You reach the next chamber Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look. Action: Look around the chamber. Observation: The chamber is dimly lit, with shadows dancing on the walls. A large, ornate mirror stands in the center, surrounded by candles. A dusty tome lies on a table nearby. The mask's beckoning grows fainter, but still urges you forward. Action: Approach the mirror. Observation: As you approach the mirror, it seems to come alive, the surface shimmering and rippling like water. The mask's features become clearer, as if reflected in the mirror's surface. Action: Look into the mirror. Observation: The mirror shows you a reflection of yourself, but also reveals the hidden truths of the Moonlit Tower. You see visions of the past, present, and future, and the mask's beckoning grows stronger once more. Action: Take the tome.

History: Observation: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom. Action: Look around the chamber carefully for any signs of life or presence. If there's no one to talk to, examine the holographic projection on the crystal orb for clues or instructions. Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look. Action: Look at the holographic projection on the crystal orb more closely. Observation: The holographic projection shows a detailed map of the Moonlit Tower, revealing the locations of hidden chambers and secret passages. One of the marked locations is a hidden laboratory in the western wing of the tower. The mask's beckoning grows excited, urging you to investigate the hidden laboratory. Action: Go to the western wing and search for the hidden laboratory. Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: Look for the entrance to the hidden laboratory in the western wing carefully. Check the walls, floors, and ceiling for any hidden doors or passages. If you can't find the entrance, examine the holographic projection on the crystal orb for more clues. Observation: That's not a verb I recognise. Action: Search the western wing carefully for the hidden laboratory entrance. Check the walls, floors, and ceiling for any hidden doors or passages. If you can't find the entrance, examine the holographic projection on the crystal orb for more clues. Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: Examine the holographic projection on the crystal orb more closely. Look for any symbols or markings that may indicate the location of the hidden laboratory entrance. If you can't find it, try reading the ancient tomes and scrolls in the chamber for more information. Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: Examine the ancient tomes and scrolls in the chamber for more information about the hidden laboratory entrance. Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: Examine the crystal orb more closely, focusing on the details of the holographic projection. Look for any symbols or markings that may indicate the location of the hidden laboratory entrance. If you can't find it, try reading the ancient tomes and scrolls in the chamber for more information. If there's a particular title or author that stands out, focus on that. Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: Examine the crystal orb's holographic projection again, focusing on the symbols and markings around the location of the hidden laboratory. If there are any specific symbols or markings that stand out, try looking up their meanings in the ancient tomes and scrolls in the chamber. If you can't find any relevant information, try touching the orb again to see if it provides any new clues or insights. Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: Examine the crystal orb's holographic projection once more, focusing on the symbols and markings around the location of the hidden laboratory. If there are any specific symbols or markings that stand out, try touching the orb to see if it provides any new clues or insights. If that doesn't work, examine the ancient tomes and scrolls in the chamber for any information related to the symbols or markings on the orb. If you find anything relevant, try using that information to locate the hidden laboratory entrance. If you're still having trouble, consider re-examining the chamber itself, as there may be hidden details or clues that you missed before. Observation: You can't see any such thing.
