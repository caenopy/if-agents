History: Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look. Action: Look around the room carefully, checking every corner and object for any sign of the map or clues related to the old mill. If I still can't find it, I'll consider asking other characters in the game for help or searching other locations for the old mill's directions. [For example, "Ask the innkeeper if he knows anything about the old mill or the person who wrote the letter."] Observation: The innkeeper seems hesitant to speak about the old mill. He mentions that it's a dangerous place and that many have gone there and never returned. Action: Consider the innkeeper's warning and decide on the next course of action. [For example, reconsider going to the old mill or gather more information before proceeding.] Observation: You notice a suspicious figure lurking in the shadows. He seems to be watching you closely. Action: Hide and observe the figure to gather more information about his intentions. [For example, "Stay hidden and try to learn more about the figure's identity and motives."] Observation: The figure seems to be waiting for someone.

Action: Look around the area for any clues about who the figure is waiting for or what they might be doing. If I can't gather enough information, I may consider approaching the figure cautiously to ask questions or observing them from a distance to learn more about their intentions. [For example, "Approach the figure from a safe distance and ask who they are waiting for and why."] Observation: The figure notices you and quickly disappears into the darkness. Action: Follow the figure to learn more about their intentions and where they might have gone. [For example, "Follow the figure quietly and try to keep a safe distance to learn more about their destination and purpose."] Observation: You come across a hidden passage leading to a secret room. Action: Enter the secret room to explore and search for any clues or items that might help in solving the game. [For example, "Search the room carefully for any hidden treasures, notes, or maps that might provide useful information."] Observation: The room is empty except for a dusty old book. Action: Examine the book carefully for any useful information or clues related to the old mill or the game's puzzle. [For example, Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look. Action: Look at the book more closely, checking for any titles, symbols, or markings that might indicate its contents or relevance to the game. If it appears to be unrelated, I may consider searching other locations or asking other characters for help. [For example, "Ask the innkeeper if he has seen any books or documents related to the old mill or the person who wrote the letter."] Observation: You can't see any such thing.
