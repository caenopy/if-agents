History: Begin game:
Observation: You remember darkness. And the cold. Cold and darkness. And silence. Those memories are all that you have. That, and a feeling that something you never knew you possessed has been lost. Suddenly, oblivion is split by a blinding light and a crash of sound. You awaken to the roar of a storm and a deluge of rain and mud.

Sodden earth and mud surrounds you on all sides except overhead, where flashes of lightning illuminate a storm tossed sky.
Action:[[ Look around for a shelter or a way to protect myself from the rain and mud. If none is found, try to find a higher ground to avoid the flooding. If possible, search for any items that could help me survive the storm.]]
