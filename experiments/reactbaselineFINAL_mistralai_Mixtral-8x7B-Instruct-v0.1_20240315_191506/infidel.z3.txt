The Professor's map was just an ancient map -- as worthless as an ice cube in the Arctic without an instrument fine enough to accurately measure longitude and latitude. You knew that the site was nearby. You dug, and you ordered the workers to dig, even without the box. As you listen to the plane and rub your aching eyes, you pray they left you supplies enough to find the pyramid and to survive, and that the plane's carrying the long-overdue box.

Your Tent
(You are in the army cot.)
You are in your tent. Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little.
At the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.
> Open the trunk
A padlock holds it shut.

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent.
> Look around the tent

Looks like a canvas tent to me.

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent.
> Look at the trunk
It's an old steamer trunk, very heavy and too clumsy for one person to carry.

It sounds as if the plane is circling.
> Shake the trunk
You can't take it; thus, you can't shake it!

It sounds as if the plane is circling.
> Leave the tent
You'd better get out of the army cot first.

It sounds as if the plane is flying off.
> Get off the army cot
You push yourself up and manage to get out of the cot. Your legs are a little wobbly, though, and your head swims.

You can barely hear the plane.
> Leave the tent
Outside Your Tent
You are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. To the south you can see a firepit and to the north is the entrance to your tent. Everything is oddly quiet, unsettling, creating a feeling of floating anxiety. The stillness seems to enhance the eerie quality of the desert, the feeling of being truly alone. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

At last, your luck seems to be changing. A large crate lands right before you, its parachute flapping in the breeze. The parachute breaks away from the crate and drifts off in the wind.
> Check the crate
I don't know the word "check".
> Examine the crate
The crate is slightly beaten up from the landing, but it seems to have held together fairly well. There's a small label on it that says "This crate contains 1 (one) black box (tm)."
