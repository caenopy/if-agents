You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: a response provided by the game based on the previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'] or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start by taking the 'Start' action to begin the game. Based on the observation from this action, I will determine the next steps to take.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
The phone rings.

Oh, no - how long have you been asleep? Sure, it was a tough night, but... This is bad. This is very bad.

The phone rings.

Bedroom (in bed)
This bedroom is extremely spare, with dirty laundry scattered haphazardly all over the floor. Cleaner clothing can be found in the dresser. A bathroom lies to the south, while a door to the east leads to the living room.

On the end table are a telephone, a wallet and some keys.

The phone rings.

Thought 2: The game has started and I am in a bedroom. There are a few items in the room that I could interact with, such as the telephone, wallet, and keys. The phone is currently ringing, which suggests that I might want to answer it. I could also explore the other rooms or check my inventory.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Answer the phone]

Observation 2:
You pick up the phone. "Hadley!" a shrill voice cries. "Hadley, haven't you even left yet?? You knew that our presentation was at nine o'clock sharp! First the thing with the printers, now this - there won't even be enough left of you for Bowman to fire once he's done with you. Now get the hell down here!!"

Click.

Thought 3: It seems that I have overslept and missed a important presentation at work. My boss is understandably upset and has instructed me to get to the office immediately. I should probably get dressed and head to the office as soon as possible.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Get dressed]

Observation 3: [!: Noun error. (This could mean a number of things: a noun used in your command may not be present, or it may be present but not visible; it may be scenery you can't interact with; you may have specified too many indirect objects; you may have misspelled something; the list goes on.)]

Thought 4: It seems that I made a mistake in my previous action. The game is telling me that there was a noun error, which means that I may have misspelled something or used a noun that is not present in the current room. I should check the items in the room and try using a different verb to interact with them.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the dresser]

Observation 4: Just a simple dresser.

Thought 5: It seems that the dresser is just a simple piece of furniture and does not have any obvious functionality. I could try opening it to see if there is anything inside, or I could try interacting with the other items in the room.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[Open the dresser]

Observation 5: You'll have to get out of bed first.

Thought 6: It seems that I need to get out of bed before I can open the dresser. I will first take the action to get out of bed, and then try opening the dresser again.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[Get out of bed]

Observation 6: You get out of bed.

Thought 7: Now that I am out of bed, I can try opening the dresser again to see if there is anything inside that I can use to get dressed.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[Open the dresser]

Observation 7: You open the dresser, revealing some clean clothing.

Thought 8: It looks like I have found some clean clothing in the dresser. I should put on the clothing so that I can get dressed and head to the office.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[Put on the clean clothing]

Observation 8:
(first taking the clean clothing)
You'll have to take off the soiled clothes you're wearing first.

Thought 9: It seems that I need to take off my dirty clothes before I can put on the clean clothing. I will first take the action to remove my dirty clothes, and then try putting on the clean clothing again.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[Take off the soiled clothes]

Observation 9: You take off the soiled clothing.

Thought 10: Now that I have removed my dirty clothes, I can try putting on the clean clothing again. This will allow me to get dressed and head to the office.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[Put on the clean clothing]

Observation 10: It seems ridiculous to put on fresh, clean clothes when you yourself are covered with mud and dried sweat.

Thought 11: It seems that I need to clean myself up before I can put on the clean clothing. There is a bathroom to the south that I could go to in order to clean myself up. I will first take the action to go to the bathroom, and then try cleaning myself up and putting on the clean clothing again.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[Go to the bathroom]

Observation 11:
Bathroom
This is a far from luxurious but still quite functional bathroom, with a sink, toilet and shower. The bedroom lies to the north.

Thought 12: Now that I am in the bathroom, I can try cleaning myself up using the sink or shower. This will allow me to remove the mud and dried sweat from my body, and then I can put on the clean clothing.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[Clean myself up]

Observation 12: [!: Verb error. (This generally means that the first word of your command was not recognized.)]

Thought 13: It seems that I made a mistake in my previous action. The game is telling me that there was a verb error, which means that the first word of my command was not recognized. I should try using a different verb to interact with the sink or shower.

Action 13: InteractiveFictionGame[Wash up]

Observation 13: [!: Command not understood past "wash."]

Thought 14: It seems that I need to be more specific in my command. I will try using a more specific verb to interact with the sink or shower.

Action 14: InteractiveFictionGame[Wash my face]

Observation 14: [!: Command not understood past "wash."]

Thought 15: It seems that I need to be even more specific in my command. I will try using a more specific verb and naming the object that I want to interact with.

Action 15: InteractiveFictionGame[Wash my face in the sink]

Observation 15: [!: Command not understood past "wash."]

Thought 16: It seems that the game does not allow me to wash my face in the sink directly. I should first try using the sink to fill a container with water, and then use the container to wash my face.

Action 16: InteractiveFictionGame[Fill a container with water]

Observation 16: [!: Verb error. (This generally means that the first word of your command was not recognized.)]

Thought 17: It seems that I made a mistake in my previous action. The game is telling me that there was a verb error, which means that the first word of my command was not recognized. I should try using a different verb to interact with the sink.

Action 17: InteractiveFictionGame[Get a container]

Observation 17: [!: Noun error. (This could mean a number of things: a noun used in your command may not be present, or it may be present but not visible; it may be scenery you can't interact with; you may have specified too many indirect objects; you may have misspelled something; the list goes on.)]

Thought 18:[[ It seems that I made a mistake in my previous action.

Action 18: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the bathroom]

Observation 18:
Bathroom
This is a far from luxurious but still quite functional bathroom, with a sink, toilet and shower. The bedroom lies to the north.

Thought 19: Now that I have examined the bathroom, I can see that there is a sink in the room. I will try using the sink to fill a container with water.

Action 19: InteractiveFictionGame[Use the sink to fill a container with water]

Observation 19: [!: Noun error. (This could mean a number of things: a noun used in your command may not be present, or it may be present but not visible; it may be scenery you can't interact with; you may have specified too many indirect objects; you may have misspelled something; the list goes on.)]

Thought 20: It seems that I made a mistake in my previous action. The game is telling me that there was a noun error, which means that the noun I used in my command may not be present or visible in the current room. I should check the items in the room and try using a different verb to interact with them.

Action 20: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the sink]

Observation 20: The sink is a sink.

Thought 21: It seems that the sink is just a simple piece of furniture and does not have any obvious functionality. However, I know that sinks are typically used to fill containers with water. I will try using the sink again to fill a container with water.

Action 21: InteractiveFictionGame[Fill a container with water from the sink]

Observation 21: [!: Noun error. (This could mean a number of things: a noun used in your command may not be present, or it may be present but not visible]]
