You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: a response provided by the game based on the previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'] or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start by taking the 'Start' action to begin the game. Based on the observation from this action, I will determine the next steps to take.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
This has never been your favorite part of the city.  Nor is this neighborhood the safest one.  But as a city sanitarian, you are charged with completing an annual health and safety inspection of every restaurant in your district.

Each day you visit three or four restaurants.  During those visits you take note of potential health code violations in your trusty notepad.  Today's first target:  Nikolai's Bar and Grill.

A hazy sun barely peeks above the three-story tenements.

19th Street
You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street.  A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room.  The front entrance is north of you.

The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with broken bottles.  Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically.  A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak.

An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

A damp sheet of newspaper has blown up against the curb.

Thought 2: Based on the observation, it seems like I am at the entrance of Nikolai's Bar and Grill, and I need to inspect the restaurant. I will start by going inside the restaurant.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[go north]

Observation 2:
(first opening the front door)
(first unlocking the front door)
You lack a key that fits the front door.

Thought 3: Based on the observation, it seems like I don't have a key to unlock the front door. I will look around to see if there is a spare key or another way to enter the restaurant.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[look around]

Observation 3: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought 4: It seems like the command "look around" was not understood by the game. I will try using a more specific command to look for a spare key or another way to enter the restaurant.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[check for a spare key]

Observation 4: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 5: Based on the observation, it seems like there is no spare key in sight. I will check the newspaper to see if there is any useful information.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[examine newspaper]

Observation 5: The newspaper scrap is worn and damp, rendering it almost unreadable.

Thought 6: Based on the observation, it seems like the newspaper is too worn and damp to read. I will try to find another way to enter the restaurant.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[go east]

Observation 6:
19th Street East
A street-front window looks into Nikolai's bar.  If you want into the bar, you'll have to go back to the restaurant entrance, which is west of here.  There are no cars on this end of 19th Street.  The sidewalk is uneven.  A curb-side storm gutter empties here into a grated storm drain.

Thought 7: Based on the observation, it seems like going back to the restaurant entrance is the only way to enter the bar. I will try to go west and enter the restaurant.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[go west]

Observation 7:
19th Street
An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

A damp sheet of newspaper has blown up against the curb.

Thought 8: Based on the observation, it seems like I am back at the entrance of the restaurant. Since I still don't have a key to unlock the front door, I will try to find another way to enter the restaurant.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[look for another entrance]

Observation 8: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought 9: It seems like the command "look for another entrance" was not understood by the game. I will try to be more specific and look for alternate ways to enter the building, such as a back door or a window.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[look for a back door or a window]

Observation 9: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought 10: It seems like the command "look for a back door or a window" was also not understood by the game. I will try to move around the building to see if I can find another entrance.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[go south]

Observation 10: All your business is on the north side of the street.  Finish your inspection so you can go home.

Thought 11: Based on the observation, it seems like I can't find another entrance on the south side of the street. I will go back to the restaurant entrance and try to find a way to open the front door.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[go north]

Observation 11:
(first opening the front door)
(first unlocking the front door)
You lack a key that fits the front door.

Thought 12: Based on the observation, I still don't have a key to unlock the front door. I have tried looking around and checking for a spare key, but I couldn't find one. I have also tried to find another entrance, but I couldn't find one either. I will examine the aluminum placard on the front door to see if it provides any useful information.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[examine placard]

Observation 12: An aluminum placard, printed in red, is fixed to the front door.

Thought 13: Based on the observation, it seems like there is an aluminum placard on the front door with red printing. I will examine the placard more closely to see if there is any useful information on it.

Action 13: InteractiveFictionGame[read placard]

Observation 13: You read: (in big red letters) CLOSED

Thought 14: Based on the observation, it seems like the placard says "CLOSED" in big red letters. It's possible that the restaurant is not open yet, and I need to come back later. I will try to go south and continue my inspection of other restaurants in the area.

Action 14: InteractiveFictionGame[go south]

Observation 14: All your business is on the north side of the street.  Finish your inspection so you can go home.

Thought 15: Based on the observation, it seems like I need to finish my inspection of the other restaurants on the north side of the street. I will continue to look for potential health code violations and take note of them in my trusty notepad. I will come back to Nikolai's Bar and Grill later when it is open.

Action 15: InteractiveFictionGame[go north]

Observation 15:
(first opening the front door)
(first unlocking the front door)
You lack a key that fits the front door.

Thought 16: Based on the observation, I still don't have a key to unlock the front door. I have tried looking around and checking for a spare key, but I couldn't find one. I have also tried to find another entrance, but I couldn't find one either. I have examined the placard on the front door, and it says "CLOSED" in big red letters. I will assume that the restaurant is not open yet and come back later. For now, I will continue to look for potential health code violations in the other restaurants in the area and take note of them in my trusty notepad.

Action 16: InteractiveFictionGame[look for health code violations]

Observation 16: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought 17: It seems like the command "look for health code violations" was not understood by the game. I need to be more specific about what I'm looking for. I will examine the surroundings of each restaurant and look for specific health code violations such as improper food storage, poor sanitation, or pest infestations.

Action 17: InteractiveFictionGame[examine surroundings for improper food storage]

Observation 17: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 18: Based on the observation, it seems like there are no visible signs of improper food storage in the current location. I will continue to move to the next restaurant and examine the surroundings for any health code violations.

Action 18: InteractiveFictionGame[go to the next restaurant]

Observation 18: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 19: It seems like the command "go to the next restaurant" was not understood by the game. I need to be more specific about which restaurant I want to go to. I will try to go to the next restaurant on my list and examine the surroundings for any health code violations.

Action 19: InteractiveFictionGame[go to the next restaurant on my list]

Observation 19: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 20: It seems like the game is not providing me with a list of restaurants to choose from. I will assume that there is only one restaurant, Nikolai's Bar and Grill, in this area that I need to inspect. I will continue to examine the surroundings of Nikolai's for any health code violations.

Action 20: InteractiveFictionGame[examine surroundings of Nikolai's for health code violations]

Observation 20: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 21: Based on the observation, it seems like there are no visible health code violations in the surroundings of Nikolai's Bar and Grill. I will try to enter the restaurant again and continue my inspection.

Action 21: InteractiveFictionGame[examine door for any other options]

Observation 21: I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the front door.

Thought 22: It seems like the command "examine door for any other options" was not understood by the game. I will try to be more specific and examine the door for any buttons, locks, or other features that might help me enter the restaurant.

Action 22: InteractiveFictionGame[examine door closely for buttons, locks, or other features]

Observation 22: I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the front door.

Thought 23: It seems like the game does not allow for a more detailed examination of the door. At this point, I have exhausted all reasonable actions to enter the restaurant. I will assume that the restaurant is not open yet and come back later. For now, I will continue to look for potential health code violations in the other restaurants in the area and take note of them in my trusty notepad.

Action 23: InteractiveFictionGame[go south]

Observation 23: All your business is on the north side of the street.  Finish your inspection so you can go home.

Action 27: InteractiveFictionGame[go home]

Observation 27: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 28: It seems like the game does not allow me to go home directly from this location. I will try to move to a different location first and then go home.

Action 28: InteractiveFictionGame[go west]

Observation 28:
19th Street West
You are walking past the window to Goldschmidt's Pawnshop (on the north side of 19th Street).  Although the shop is closed right now, the window provides a neat display of hocked merchandise.  Nikolai's Bar and Grill is east.  To the west, the neighborhood becomes even seedier.

Goldschmidt's is closed for the day.  The door is locked.

Thought 29: Based on the observation, it seems like I am near Goldschmidt's Pawnshop, which is closed for the day. I will continue to move west and head home.
