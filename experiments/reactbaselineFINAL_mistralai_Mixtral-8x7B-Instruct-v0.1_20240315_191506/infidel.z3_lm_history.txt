You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: a response provided by the game based on the previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'] or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start by taking the 'Start' action to begin the game. Based on the observation from this action, I will determine the next steps to take.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
The Professor's map was just an ancient map -- as worthless as an ice cube in the Arctic without an instrument fine enough to accurately measure longitude and latitude. You knew that the site was nearby. You dug, and you ordered the workers to dig, even without the box. As you listen to the plane and rub your aching eyes, you pray they left you supplies enough to find the pyramid and to survive, and that the plane's carrying the long-overdue box.

Your Tent
(You are in the army cot.)
You are in your tent. Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little.
At the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.

Thought 2: It seems like I am in a tent and there is a trunk at the foot of the cot. I should check the trunk to see if it contains any supplies that I can use.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Open the trunk]

Observation 2:
A padlock holds it shut.

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent.

Thought 3: The trunk is locked, so I need to find a way to open it. I could try to pick the lock or find the key. Since I don't have any tools to pick the lock, I should look for the key. I will check the tent for the key.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around the tent]

Observation 3:
Your Tent
(You are in the army cot.)
You are in your tent. Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little.
At the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent.

Thought 4: I have already looked around the tent, and I didn't see the key. I should check if there is a place where the key might be hidden or stored. I will look for any clues or indications of a hiding spot in the tent.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[Check for any hiding spots in the tent]

Observation 4: I don't know the word "check".

Thought 5: It seems like the game doesn't understand the command "Check for any hiding spots in the tent". I will try to be more specific and search the tent for any possible hiding places.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[Search the tent for hiding places]

Observation 5: I don't know the word "hiding".

Thought 6: It seems like the game doesn't understand the words "check" and "hiding". I need to find a way to communicate my intentions more clearly. I will try to be more explicit and search the tent thoroughly for any objects that could be a key or a hiding place for the key.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[Thoroughly search the tent for any objects that could be a key or a hiding place]

Observation 6: I don't know the word "thoroughly".

Thought 7: It seems like the game doesn't understand some of the words I'm using. I will try to use simpler words and actions. I will examine the tent more closely to see if I can find any clues or hints about where the key might be.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the tent closely]

Observation 7: I don't know the word "closely".

Thought 8: It seems like the game doesn't understand some of the words I'm using. I will try to use the most basic words and actions. I will examine the tent to see if I can find any clues or hints about where the key might be.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the tent]

Observation 8:
Looks like a canvas tent to me.

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent.

Thought 9: It seems like the tent itself doesn't contain any useful information. I should check the surroundings outside the tent. Before I leave the tent, I will check if there is anything interesting inside the trunk, even though it is locked.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[Look at the trunk]

Observation 9:
It's an old steamer trunk, very heavy and too clumsy for one person to carry.

It sounds as if the plane is circling.

Thought 10: It seems like the trunk is too heavy to move, and I cannot open it without the key. Since I have searched the tent thoroughly and found no clues about the key's location, I should now focus on exploring the surroundings outside the tent. Before I leave the tent, I will try one more time to see if there is anything I can do with the trunk. I will try to shake it or listen for any sounds that might indicate something inside.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[Shake the trunk]

Observation 10:
You can't take it; thus, you can't shake it!

It sounds as if the plane is circling.

Thought 11: It seems like I can't interact with the trunk in that way. I should now focus on exploring the surroundings outside the tent. I will leave the tent and see what I can find.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[Leave the tent]

Observation 11:
You'd better get out of the army cot first.

It sounds as if the plane is flying off.

Thought 12: It seems like I need to get off the army cot before I can leave the tent. I will do that and then proceed to explore the surroundings outside the tent.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[Get off the army cot]

Observation 12:
You push yourself up and manage to get out of the cot. Your legs are a little wobbly, though, and your head swims.

You can barely hear the plane.

Thought 13: It seems like I have successfully gotten off the army cot. I should now proceed to leave the tent and explore the surroundings.

Action 13: InteractiveFictionGame[Leave the tent]

Observation 13:
Outside Your Tent
You are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. To the south you can see a firepit and to the north is the entrance to your tent. Everything is oddly quiet, unsettling, creating a feeling of floating anxiety. The stillness seems to enhance the eerie quality of the desert, the feeling of being truly alone. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

At last, your luck seems to be changing. A large crate lands right before you, its parachute flapping in the breeze. The parachute breaks away from the crate and drifts off in the wind.

Thought 14: It seems like a crate has just landed outside the tent. This could be the long-overdue box that the Professor mentioned. I should check the crate to see if it contains any useful supplies or tools that I can use.

Action 14: InteractiveFictionGame[Check the crate]

Observation 14: I don't know the word "check".

Thought 15: It seems like the game doesn't understand the command "Check the crate". I will try to be more specific and examine the crate to see what's inside.

Action 15: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the crate]

Observation 15: The crate is slightly beaten up from the landing, but it seems to have held together fairly well. There's a small label on it that says "This crate contains 1 (one) black box (tm)."

Thought 16: It seems like the crate contains a black box. This could be the long-overdue box that the Professor mentioned. I should open the crate and check the black box to see if it contains any useful supplies or tools that I can use.

Action 16: InteractiveFictionGame[Open the crate]

Observation 16: The crate opens slowly, the boards creaking with the strain. Opening the packing crate reveals a navigation box.

Thought 17: It seems like the crate contained a navigation box, which could be useful for accurately measuring longitude and latitude. However, the observation does not mention any keys or tools that I can use to open the trunk. Since I have explored the tent and the immediate surroundings, I should now consider expanding my search area. I will examine the path to the east and west of the encampment to see if there are any clues or objects that could help me open the trunk.

Action 17: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the path to the east]

Observation 17: I don't know the word "path".
