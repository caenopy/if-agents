You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: a response provided by the game based on the previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'] or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start by taking the 'Start' action to begin the game. Based on the observation from this action, I will determine the next steps to take.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

You are a student at Anycollege, in Anytown, and it's the end of the semester!  You've been slacking off all semester long, and it's catching up to you. That final paper is due for your Computer Science class ("The History of IF Games"), and you desperately need to check out a comprehensive book on Graham Nelson, one of the foremost authors of the obscure genre of interactive-fiction. You know there is exactly one such book, but you have no idea where it might be! 

The first time player should probably type "help".

Standard interpreter 1.0

Lobby
This is the entrance to the library. The circulation desk dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of desks and tables. A pair of security gates stands before the front doors to prevent people from stealing books. A card catalog lurks in a dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh flourescent light. Glass doors to the west lead to the book stacks; an archway to the northwest is labelled "Duplicating Services"; a door to the north bears a sign marked "Private" in large friendly letters; and the exit is to the east

You can see a circulation desk attendant here.

Thought 2: Now that I have a better understanding of the game's setting, I should start by exploring the library to find the book I need. I can check the card catalog to see if it has any information about the location of the book. If I can't find it there, I can try asking the circulation desk attendant for help.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Check card catalog]

Observation 2: Almost no light penetrates this corner of the room. The card catalog is in the usual shape, a box on legs with a myriad of small drawers, each labelled in crabbed writing. However, the entire card catalog is festooned with cobwebs. The dust on top is so thick that it looks like grubby grey felt.

Thought 3: The card catalog seems to be in disuse and covered in dust, which suggests that it might not be the most reliable source of information. However, it's still worth checking since it's the only lead I have. I can try searching for the book by its author, Graham Nelson.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Search card catalog for Graham Nelson]

Observation 3: I only understood you as far as wanting to search the card catalog.

Thought 4: It seems I need to specify how to search the card catalog. I will try searching for the author's name, Graham Nelson, alphabetically in the card catalog.

Action 26: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the circulation desk]

Observation 26: The signs of careful scavenging of whatever materials came to hand are present. There are many outdated notices and signs posted on the walls nearby.

Thought 27: It seems that the circulation desk attendant is not present at the circulation desk. I will try moving to a different location in the library to see if I can find the attendant or any other sources of information. Specifically, I will go to the door to the north with the "Private" sign.

Action 27: InteractiveFictionGame[Go to the door to the north marked "Private"]

Observation 27: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 28: It seems that the "Private" door is not currently visible. I will try looking around the room again to see if I can find any visible exits or features.
