The note was written on a computer obviously this murder was planned and it says:
We have acclaimed Justice! The Justice of the future! Our next hit is the governer! You CAN'T STOP US! The note sounds like the killers are a group and that they are vigilantes (look it up). You are now getting a bit worried.
