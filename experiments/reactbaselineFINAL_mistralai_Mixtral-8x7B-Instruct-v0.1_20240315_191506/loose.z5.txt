What was that?

You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.

"No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind."

After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.

Rickety Fence
The ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other. Although it hasn't fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and if that egg isn't careful...

The footpath running along the fence veers sharply north.

The egg hums a little tune your mother used to sing at bedtime.
> Climb the fence
The fence is much too high and unsteady for you to climb. How on earth did that egg get up there?
> Talk to the egg
To talk to the egg, try this: "egg, do something"
> egg, do something
"Pardon? I'm not quite certain what you meant."
> egg, how can I help you?
"Pardon? I'm not quite certain what you meant."
> I point at the fence and make gestures indicating that I want to help the egg
I only understood you as far as wanting to inventory.
> egg, do you need help getting down from the fence?
"Pardon? I'm not quite certain what you meant."
> Go north
Bravely, the egg calls after you: "My life is in your hands! I trust you will return shortly to rescue me!"

Forest
The sun has disappeared. Only a narrow north-south passage winds through the forest here; trees and gnarled undergrowth barricade all other exits. Chill air seeps up from the ground and coils around your body, reaching down your neck with insistent, clammy fingers.
> Go south

"Leaving so soon?" sighs the egg. "Well, be careful. Dangerous creatures lurk in the shadows."

> Go east
You trudge along, trees to your left, fence to your right. After a little while, you sit down to rest. The fence and the road look the same here; nothing has changed, except that now you're completely alone on a road to nowhere. Discouraged, you stand up and trudge all the way back to the egg.
