Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.

Void
You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner.
> Look around
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> Examine surroundings
You can't see any such thing.
> Look at the hazy objects
They are sometimes stationary, sometimes moving around. Their movement is not linear and they seem to suddenly dissolve from one place, only to appear from nothing in a new place, apparently at random. Although they sometimes are close to you they always appear hazy.

A cascade of red colour explodes below you.
> Go south
You move, or rather you come to a new place. The concept of body and movement seems different here.

Void
This new location is not much different from the one you came from. The shadows are still moving around at random through the abyss, reverberating with strange sounds and coloured light.

Suddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long.
> Move away from the fearful shape
You can't see any such thing.
> Go north
In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.

The shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.

Roof
The city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star-filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down.
> Examine the roof
Judging from the masonry the tower must be centuries old. It towers high above the nightmarish city below.
> Go down the staircase
I only understood you as far as wanting to go the floor.
> Go down the winding staircase
I only understood you as far as wanting to go the floor.
> Walk down the winding staircase
I only understood you as far as wanting to walk the floor.
> Go down
The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.

Study
Dust and spider webs cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam, blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic, dreamy forms. The walls are lined with bookshelves and a lone desk lies at one corner. Close to a staircase, which leads further up and down the tower, is a massive table made of black stone. A doorway leads to a smaller room to the south.

On the desk is a yellow paper.
> Examine the yellow paper
On the paper is a coded message and it is impossible to say even in which language the text is written.
> Examine the bookshelves
The bookshelves are  filled with bound volumes that are crumbling with age.
> Examine the massive table made of black stone
You can't see any such thing.
> Look at the black stone table
The base of the stone table is covered with carvings, each showing different kinds of creatures, or maybe Gods, standing on stone tables. Humans, who seem to be reciting prayers or spells, are standing in front of the creatures.

You spot something behind the table. Pushing the cobwebs aside, you reveal some writing, crudely painted on the stone wall with black paint.
> Examine the writing on the stone wall
I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the writing.
> Read the writing on the stone wall
I only understood you as far as wanting to read the writing.
> Carefully read the crudely painted writing on the stone wall behind the black stone table
That's not a verb I recognise.

You can't see any such thing.

> Move closer
You can't see any such thing.

> Look at the wall behind the black stone table

> Go up the staircase
I only understood you as far as wanting to go the ceiling.
> Climb up the staircase
Hall
This damp hall occupies the whole ground level of the tower. A staircase provides access to the higher levels, while a massive oak door, set in the southern wall, leads out.
> Examine the oak door
The door is big and made of crude oak logs, which have darkened to almost black with time and wear. The lock and the iron handle look handcrafted and antique.
> Open the oak door
You press the handle and try to open the door, but find that it won't budge.
> Examine the hall
You can't see any such thing.
> Look around the hall
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> Check the corners of the hall
You can't see any such thing.

> Examine the staircase
The steps are uncomfortably high, and seem to have been designed for someone much taller than you.
