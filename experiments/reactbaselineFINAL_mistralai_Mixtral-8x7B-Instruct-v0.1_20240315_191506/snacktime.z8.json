That is a good room.\n\nEven though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of \"no\"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.\n\nYour pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.",
