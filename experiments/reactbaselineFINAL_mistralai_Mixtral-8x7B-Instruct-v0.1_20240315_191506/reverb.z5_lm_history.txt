You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: a response provided by the game based on the previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'] or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start by taking the 'Start' action to begin the game. Based on the observation from this action, I will determine the next steps to take.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice.

Anyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new "Surfers Monthly" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening.

Shyeah, right. That's what YOU think.

Behind the Counter
You are behind the counter at "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor", where you are currently working. Not much of a job, but it keeps you from going broke during the nine months of the year when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing instructor. The rest of the parlor is southwest.

There is something pressing that you think you have to do, but you can't think what it might be.

Thought 2: The game has provided a detailed description of the current location, which is a pizza parlor. There is no specific task or objective mentioned yet. I should explore the parlor to find any clues or objectives. I will go southwest to see the rest of the parlor.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Go southwest]

Observation 2:
You walk around to the front of the pizza parlor.

Pizza Parlor
You are standing in the middle of "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor". The counter separating you from the back of the parlor stretches in front of you on the northeast corner of the room. To the south is an exit to the street.

Thought 3: The observation indicates that I have moved to the front of the pizza parlor. There are no explicit actions to take here, but I should explore more to find any clues or objectives. I will go to the south, which is indicated as an exit to the street.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Go south]

Observation 3:
Street, by Pizza Parlor
San Doppleton is where you live, work and play -- at least until summer. It has the typical California culture; which is to say, none. But at least it's just forty minutes' drive from Santa Barbara and the beach, so you can't complain much.

You stand in the heart of San Doppleton's main drag, the business district. The street goes east and west. The sidewalk runs by a pizza parlor, with a sewer vent nearby.

Two men bump into each other. They murmur apologies and go their separate ways.

Thought 4: The game has provided a description of the street outside the pizza parlor. There are no explicit actions to take here, but exploring the area might be beneficial. I will go east and west to see if there are any significant locations.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation 4:
Street, by Department Store
On this end of the street, a department store called Barkley's sits to the south.

Two men bump into each other. They murmur apologies and go their separate ways.

Thought 5: The observation indicates that I am near a department store called Barkley's. There are no explicit actions to take here, but visiting the department store might be interesting. I will go south to enter the store.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[Go south]

Observation 5:
Clothing Department
You are in the clothing department at Barkley's. There are many racks of clothes here. You may exit to the north. To the southwest lies the hardware department, and southeast is the cosmetics department.

You can see a store clerk here.

Thought 6: The game has provided a description of the clothing department in Barkley's department store. I can see a store clerk here. Interacting with the store clerk might provide useful information or clues. I will talk to the store clerk.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[Talk to the store clerk]

Observation 6: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 7: The game does not recognize "Talk to" as a valid verb. I should try using a different verb to interact with the store clerk. I will try "Ask" instead.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[Ask the store clerk about the job]

Observation 7: The clerk doesn't want anything to do with you unless you are buying something.

Thought 8: The store clerk is not willing to engage in a conversation unless I'm buying something. It seems like there's no useful information to gain from the store clerk at the moment. I should explore other areas or interact with other characters if they appear. For now, I will go back to the pizza parlor and see if there are any new developments.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation 8:
Street, by Department Store

Two men bump into each other. They murmur apologies and go their separate ways.

Thought 9: The observation indicates that I am back on the street in front of the pizza parlor. There are no new developments here, so I will go back inside the pizza parlor to see if there are any new developments or clues.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[Go northwest]

Observation 9:
The street runs back west, and Barkley's is to the south.

Two teenaged girls go by carrying shopping bags.

Thought 10: The observation indicates that I am back in the pizza parlor, as there is no explicit mention of a change in location. There are no new developments or explicit actions to take here. I will wait for a moment to see if anything changes or if any new actions become available.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[Wait]

Observation 10:
Time passes.

A guy in a business suit walks past you.

Thought 11: The observation indicates that time has passed, and a guy in a business suit has walked past me. There are no new developments or explicit actions to take here. I will continue to wait and see if anything changes or if any new actions become available.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[Wait]

Observation 11:
Time passes.

A guy in a business suit walks past you.

Thought 12: The observation indicates that time has passed again, and the guy in a business suit has walked past me once more. There are still no new developments or explicit actions to take here. However, the repeated appearance of the man in a business suit might be a clue. I will try to follow him and see where he goes.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[Follow the man in a business suit]

Observation 12: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 13: The game does not recognize "Follow" as a valid verb. I should try using a different verb to interact with the man in a business suit. I will try "Go" in the direction he went instead.

Action 13: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation 13:
Street, by Pizza Parlor

A guy in a business suit walks past you.

Thought 14: The observation indicates that the man in a business suit has walked past me again. Since I am now on the street by the pizza parlor, I will continue to follow him and see where he goes.

Action 14: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation 14:
Street, Near Courthouse
You are approaching the center of downtown San Doppleton. There is a courthouse to the south. The street runs east and west.

Thought 15: The observation indicates that I am now near the courthouse. The man in a business suit is still in sight, so I will continue to follow him and see where he goes.

Action 15: InteractiveFictionGame[Go south]

Observation 15:
Courthouse
You are in a crowded courthouse.  The street is off to the north.

The courtroom is currently abuzz with excitement as it seems that the pre-trial hearing of the infamous gangster, Guido "The Armadillo" Calzone is winding to a close. Guido and his hotshot lawyer sit placidly at their table, while the flustered young district attorney who is prosecuting the case seems like she's at her wits' end. At the moment, the D.A. stands at the front of the courtroom, arguing over a legal point with the judge.

Thought 16: The observation indicates that I am now inside the courthouse, where a pre-trial hearing for the gangster Guido "The Armadillo" Calzone is taking place. This is a significant event, and it might be related to the game's story or objectives. I should explore the courthouse and gather more information about the trial.

Action 16: InteractiveFictionGame[Explore the courthouse]

Observation 16: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 17: The game does not recognize "Explore" as a valid verb. I should try using a different verb to interact with the courthouse. I will try "Look around" instead.

Action 17: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around]

Observation 17: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought 18: The game does not recognize "Look around" as a valid verb. I should try using a more specific verb to interact with the courthouse. I will try "Observe the courtroom" instead.

Action 18: InteractiveFictionGame[Observe the courtroom]

Observation 18: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 19: The game does not recognize "Observe" as a valid verb. I should try using a more specific verb to interact with the courthouse. I will try "Watch the trial" instead.

Action 19: InteractiveFictionGame[Watch the trial]

Observation 19: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 20: The game does not recognize "Watch" as a valid verb, or there is no trial visible from my current position. I should try to move closer to the courtroom to observe the trial.

Action 20: InteractiveFictionGame[Go towards the courtroom]

Observation 20: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 21: The game does not recognize "Go towards" as a valid verb, or there is no explicit direction to the courtroom from my current position. I should try to find a more specific location or path to reach the courtroom.

Action 21: InteractiveFictionGame[Go to the street]

Observation 21: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 22: The game does not recognize "Go to the street" as a valid verb or there is no street visible from my current position. It seems I'm already in the courthouse, so I should try to find a more specific location or path to reach the courtroom. I will try to go north, as it might lead me closer to the courtroom.

Action 22: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation 22: Street, Near Courthouse

Thought 23: The observation indicates that I am now on the street near the courthouse. I must have made a mistake in my previous action. I will re-enter the courthouse and try to find a way to the courtroom again.

Action 23: InteractiveFictionGame[Go south]

Observation 23:
Courthouse

"Miss Thompson," says the judge, "I've had about enough of you wasting this court's time. Unless you can demonstrate a clear threat to public safety, I'm going to recommend that Mr. Calzone be transported to a minimum security prison pending further review. His trial is to be held next week."  The district attorney is clearly not happy with this pronouncement.

Thought 24: The observation indicates that I am inside the courthouse, and a judge is making a pronouncement about the trial of Guido "The Armadillo" Calzone. This is a significant event, and it might be related to the game's story or objectives. I should try to gather more information about the trial and the judge's decision.

Action 24: InteractiveFictionGame[Listen to the judge's pronouncement]

Observation 24: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 25: The game does not recognize "Listen" as a valid verb, or there is no explicit object for me to listen to. I should try to find a more specific location or path to reach the source of the pronouncement. Since the judge is making the pronouncement, I will try to move closer to the judge and observe the trial.

Action 25: InteractiveFictionGame[Go towards the judge]

Observation 25: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 26: The game does not recognize "Go towards" as a valid verb or there is no explicit direction to the judge from my current position. It seems I'm already close to the judge, but I can't see them. There might be an obstruction or a limited field of view. I should try to move around or interact with the environment to improve my view of the courtroom.

Action 26: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around the courtroom]

Observation 26: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought 27: The game does not recognize "Look around" as a valid verb. I should try using a more specific verb to interact with the courtroom. I will try "Observe the courtroom" instead.

Action 27: InteractiveFictionGame[Observe the courtroom]

Observation 27: That's not a verb I recognise.

Action 28: InteractiveFictionGame[Watch the trial]

Observation 28: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 29: The game does not recognize "Watch" as a valid verb, or there is no trial visible from my current position. It seems I'm still unable to see the trial despite being in the courthouse. I should consider changing my approach or trying to interact with other characters in the courthouse to gather more information about the trial. I will approach the district attorney and try to talk to her.

Action 29: InteractiveFictionGame[Talk to the district attorney]

Observation 29: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 30: The game does not recognize "Talk" as a valid verb. I should try using a more specific verb to interact with the district attorney. I will try "Ask" instead.

Action 30: InteractiveFictionGame[Ask the district attorney about the trial]

Observation 30:
"Please don't interrupt, I'm giving testimony."

"Your honor, I wish you would reconsider," says the district attorney. "The defendant has a long history of disappearances, and it is counsel's opinion that he will not be around in a week to stand trial. I recommend transporting him to a more secure prison."

Thought 31:[[ The district attorney is giving testimony and is not available for conversation at the moment. I will wait for her to finish and then try to talk to her again.

Action 31: InteractiveFictionGame[Wait]

Observation 31:
"Your honor, I wish you would reconsider," says the district attorney. "The defendant has a long history of disappearances, and it is counsel's opinion that he will not be around in a week to stand trial. I recommend transporting him to a more secure prison."
