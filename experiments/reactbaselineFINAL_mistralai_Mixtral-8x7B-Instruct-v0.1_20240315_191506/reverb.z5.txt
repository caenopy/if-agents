Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice.

Anyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new "Surfers Monthly" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening.

Shyeah, right. That's what YOU think.

Behind the Counter
You are behind the counter at "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor", where you are currently working. Not much of a job, but it keeps you from going broke during the nine months of the year when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing instructor. The rest of the parlor is southwest.

There is something pressing that you think you have to do, but you can't think what it might be.
> Go southwest
You walk around to the front of the pizza parlor.

Pizza Parlor
You are standing in the middle of "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor". The counter separating you from the back of the parlor stretches in front of you on the northeast corner of the room. To the south is an exit to the street.
> Go south
Street, by Pizza Parlor
San Doppleton is where you live, work and play -- at least until summer. It has the typical California culture; which is to say, none. But at least it's just forty minutes' drive from Santa Barbara and the beach, so you can't complain much.

You stand in the heart of San Doppleton's main drag, the business district. The street goes east and west. The sidewalk runs by a pizza parlor, with a sewer vent nearby.

Two men bump into each other. They murmur apologies and go their separate ways.
> Go east
Street, by Department Store
On this end of the street, a department store called Barkley's sits to the south.

Two men bump into each other. They murmur apologies and go their separate ways.
> Go south
Clothing Department
You are in the clothing department at Barkley's. There are many racks of clothes here. You may exit to the north. To the southwest lies the hardware department, and southeast is the cosmetics department.

You can see a store clerk here.
> Talk to the store clerk
That's not a verb I recognise.
> Ask the store clerk about the job
The clerk doesn't want anything to do with you unless you are buying something.

> Go northwest
The street runs back west, and Barkley's is to the south.

Two teenaged girls go by carrying shopping bags.

Time passes.

A guy in a business suit walks past you.

Street, Near Courthouse
You are approaching the center of downtown San Doppleton. There is a courthouse to the south. The street runs east and west.
> Go south
Courthouse
You are in a crowded courthouse.  The street is off to the north.

The courtroom is currently abuzz with excitement as it seems that the pre-trial hearing of the infamous gangster, Guido "The Armadillo" Calzone is winding to a close. Guido and his hotshot lawyer sit placidly at their table, while the flustered young district attorney who is prosecuting the case seems like she's at her wits' end. At the moment, the D.A. stands at the front of the courtroom, arguing over a legal point with the judge.
> Explore the courthouse
That's not a verb I recognise.
> Look around
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> Observe the courtroom
That's not a verb I recognise.
> Watch the trial
You can't see any such thing.
> Go towards the courtroom
You can't see any such thing.

Courthouse

"Miss Thompson," says the judge, "I've had about enough of you wasting this court's time. Unless you can demonstrate a clear threat to public safety, I'm going to recommend that Mr. Calzone be transported to a minimum security prison pending further review. His trial is to be held next week."  The district attorney is clearly not happy with this pronouncement.
> Listen to the judge's pronouncement
You can't see any such thing.
> Go towards the judge
You can't see any such thing.
> Look around the courtroom

> Watch the trial

> Talk to the district attorney
That's not a verb I recognise.
> Ask the district attorney about the trial
"Please don't interrupt, I'm giving testimony."

"Your honor, I wish you would reconsider," says the district attorney. "The defendant has a long history of disappearances, and it is counsel's opinion that he will not be around in a week to stand trial. I recommend transporting him to a more secure prison."
> Wait
Time passes.

"Your opinion is duly noted, Miss Thompson," says the judge sarcastically. "But the fact is, the 'long history' you refer to is based on hearsay. Now, I recommend you gather some solid evidence when you prepare for the trial, because the minimal research you've obviously done won't be enough to convict the defendant."
