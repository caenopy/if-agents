You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: a response provided by the game based on the previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'] or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Release 1 / Serial number 000715 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 SD

<< Chief's office >>
You are standing in the Chief's office. He is telling you "The Mayor was murdered yeaterday night at 12:03 am. I want you to solve it before we get any bad publicity or the FBI has to come in. "Yessir!" You reply. He hands you a sheet of paper. Once you have read it, go north or west.

You can see a piece of white paper here.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

Thought 2: The game has provided me with the initial scene and some context about the murder of the Mayor. I should read the sheet of paper for more information. I can also look around the room to see if there are any clues.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Read paper]

Observation 2:
CONFIDENTIAL:
Detective was created by Matt Barringer.
He has worked hard on this so you better enjoy it.
I did have fun making it though. But I'd REALLY appreciate it if you were kind enough to send a postcard or... dare I even say it?... money... to:
Matt Barringer
325 Olive Ave
Piedmont
CA 94611
Just tell me if you like it or not.
If you want to talk to me over a BBS call the Ghostbuster Central BBS at (510)208-5657.
There is an Exile Games file area. Have fun. I WILL give hints out over the BBS to any of my games.

Thought 3: The paper I read appears to be a message from the game's creator, Matt Barringer, requesting feedback and potentially offering hints. It doesn't seem to contain any relevant information for the case. I should continue exploring the room and look for clues.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around]

Observation 3: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought 4: It seems that I need to specify what I want to look at in the room. I can see a piece of white paper mentioned in the observation, so I will try looking at that.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[Look at paper]

Observation 4: It is a piece of white paper.

Thought 5: The paper doesn't seem to have any writing on it, so it's probably not the sheet of paper the Chief handed me. I should look for other objects in the room.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine room]

Observation 5: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 6: It seems that the game doesn't recognize "Examine room" as a valid command. I should try a different approach to looking around the room. I can try using the 'look' command without any arguments to see if that provides more information.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[Look]

Observation 6:
<< Chief's office >>
You are standing in the Chief's office. He is telling you "The Mayor was murdered yeaterday night at 12:03 am. I want you to solve it before we get any bad publicity or the FBI has to come in. "Yessir!" You reply. He hands you a sheet of paper. Once you have read it, go north or west.

You can see a piece of white paper here.

Thought 7: The 'look' command has provided me with the same information as before. I have already read the sheet of paper the Chief handed me, so I should go north or west as suggested. I will first try going north to see where that leads me.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation 7:
<< Outside >>
You are outside in the cold. To the east is a dead end. To the west is the rest of the street. Papers are blowing around. It's amazingly cold for this time of year.

Thought 8: I have arrived outside, and it is cold and windy. There are no obvious clues here, so I will head back inside and try going west to see where that leads me.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation 8:
<< Outside >>
You are still on the streets. To the north is a restraunt where the mayor ate often. To the east is the Mayor's home.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

Thought 9: I have arrived on the streets and can see a restaurant to the north where the mayor ate often and the Mayor's home to the east. Since the Mayor's home might be a relevant location for the case, I will go east and investigate.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation 9:
<< Mayor's house >>
You are in the house, at the scene of the crime. You enter and flash your badge before a cop. He admits you. To the north is the upstairs. To the east is the living room and to the west is the dining room.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

Thought 10: I have arrived at the Mayor's house, which is the scene of the crime. I can go upstairs, to the living room to the east, or to the dining room to the west. I will first try going to the living room to the east to see if there are any clues there.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation 10:
<< Living room >>
You are standing in the living room. You see a battered piece of wood. You wonder "Should I pick this thing up?". Well, whether you do or don't the only way out of the room is back west.

You can see a wooden wood here.

Thought 11: I see a battered piece of wood in the living room, which might be a clue. I should examine it more closely to see if there is any useful information. After that, I will go back west to the dining room.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine wood]

Observation 11: You look at it closely and figure that the guys in the forensic's lab would be better at this than you.

Thought 12: The game suggests that the forensic lab would be better equipped to examine the wood. Since I cannot do much more with it, I will go back west to the dining room as planned.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation 12:
<< Mayor's house >>
You are in the house, at the scene of the crime. You enter and flash your badge before a cop. He admits you. To the north is the upstairs. To the east is the living room and to the west is the dining room.

Thought 13: I am in the main room of the Mayor's house. I can go upstairs, to the living room to the east, or to the dining room to the west. I will first try going to the dining room to the west to see if there are any clues there.

Action 13: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation 13:
<< Dining room >>
You are in the dining room. You look around and see a note on the table. You can go back east.

You can see a paper note here.

Thought 14: I see a paper note in the dining room, which might be a clue. I should examine it more closely to see if there is any useful information.

Action 14: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine note]

Observation 14: It is a note. With writing on it.

Thought 15: The note has writing on it, so it might contain relevant information. I should read the note to find out what it says.

Action 15: InteractiveFictionGame[Read note]

Observation 15:
The note was written on a computer obviously this murder was planned and it says:
We have acclaimed Justice! The Justice of the future! Our next hit is the governer! You CAN'T STOP US! The note sounds like the killers are a group and that they are vigilantes (look it up). You are now getting a bit worried.

Thought 16: The note contains a threatening message from the killers, claiming responsibility for the Mayor's murder and announcing their next target as the Governor. They seem to be a group of vigilantes. This information is crucial to the case, and I should inform the Chief immediately.

Action 16: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

<< Mayor's house >>
You are in the house, at the scene of the crime. You enter and flash your badge before a cop. He admits you. To the north is the upstairs. To the east is the living room and to the west is the dining room.

Thought 17: I am back in the main room of the Mayor's house. I should go to the Chief's office to inform him about the note and its contents. I can go north to the upstairs or east to the living room, but neither of those options will take me to the Chief's office. I will go back outside and then head north to the street, where I can find the Chief's office.
