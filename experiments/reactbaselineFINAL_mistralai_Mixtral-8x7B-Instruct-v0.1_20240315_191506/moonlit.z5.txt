No, not a prison, though stone stands around you, as expressionless as a mirror awaiting face and form; and in the silence you hear no plaint of flute or roar of gong, but instead the crash of porcelain shattering.

Moonlit Chamber
Moonlight diffuses through the walls, tracing out unreadable sigils in calligraphies of light and dark. Stairs adorned with bas-relief motifs spiral downward.

You can see a porcelain mask here.
> examine mask
The half-mask is the pale, almost bluish color of the finest celadon, cracked with uncanny precision down its axis of symmetry. The face in its blank, sculpted features has no more personality than new-forged steel. Half a mask, though--that must mean the left half is--
> examine left half of mask
You can't see any such thing.

The walls confine you as surely as the skeleton constrains the flesh, or the sheath constrains the sword.

> go up stairs
I only understood you as far as wanting to go the ceiling.
> go up
You are no magician to soar like the summer crane or the autumn hawk, and in any case, the blue-painted rafters arch above you to a remote and unassailable peak.
> examine mask
The half-mask is the pale, almost bluish color of the finest celadon, cracked with uncanny precision down its axis of symmetry. The face in its blank, sculpted features has no more personality than new-forged steel. Half a mask, though--that must mean the left half is--
> use mask
That's not a verb I recognise.
> wear mask
The thought of putting this mask on suggests to you a disturbing question: how long have you been wearing porcelain as a face?
> take off mask
You can't see any such thing.
> examine stairs
Each step is carved upon the side in bas-relief, though the design is abstract.
> study bas-relief
That's not a verb I recognise.
> examine bas-relief
Like fingerprints cast upon paper by a careless calligrapher, though you cannot read the symbols, if symbols they are.

You are no magician to soar like the summer crane or the autumn hawk, and in any case, the blue-painted rafters arch above you to a remote and unassailable peak.

I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

You can't see any such thing.

A phrase of melody comes to you: an old court air.
> sing another phrase
I only understood you as far as wanting to sing.
> sing 'moonlit tower'
I only understood you as far as wanting to sing.
> sing 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star'
I only understood you as far as wanting to sing.

I didn't understand that sentence.
> meditate
That's not a verb I recognise.
> break mask
This mask shattered once, and only once, in a terrible clean fracture.
> examine mask
The half-mask is the pale, almost bluish color of the finest celadon, cracked with uncanny precision down its axis of symmetry. The face in its blank, sculpted features has no more personality than new-forged steel. Half a mask, though--that must mean the left half is--

You can't see any such thing.
