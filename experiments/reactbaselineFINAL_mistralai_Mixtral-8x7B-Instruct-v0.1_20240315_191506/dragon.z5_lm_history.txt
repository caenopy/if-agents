You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: a response provided by the game based on the previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'] or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start by taking the 'Start' action to begin the game. Based on the observation from this action, I will determine the next steps to take.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
The faces of the council members look grim. Gilgern continues to speak. 
"Of course, something must be done soon," he says in that gruff, hearty voice you have come to dislike so much. "Must restore public confidence and encourage the return of people to the land. Can't just leave the place to the likes of dragons and trolls. We must all make money again. Isn't as though it's just arrived, dragon's been there for years. Just that people found out about it, that's all." 
Marzipam looks round nervously at the others in the so-called Council of the Wise. 
"Of course, we can't afford to pay you much. We are just poor men ourselves. Think of this more as a civic duty..." he wheezes. 
Around you the other travellers and adventurers shift nervously. 
Gilgern hurriedly adjusts his glasses and glances down at the scroll in front of him. "Says here that the Great Worm can be beaten," he goes on. "Sword of Erondil is the only weapon which can penetrate a dragon's scaly hide. Enchanted weapon, you see. Last seen many years ago in the Castle of Abercorn. Big, ugly place. Near the sea, I think, if memory serves me right. Dragon must be getting a bit careless and lazy by now. Been there all that time. Stands to reason. Might get in a lucky hit or something." 
Marzipam breaks in. "Or there's the spell, I suppose. The dragon is supposed to be held in place under an old enchantment, though that's perhaps just an old tale. Break the spell and the dragon will leave, the story goes..." 
"Well, which of you is interested?" Gilgern looks across at you and the other adventurers. You begin to wish you had never set foot in the town - it just happened to be on your journey, that's all. You've no wish to tangle with dangerous dragons or anything else. 
As Gilgern looks down, you suddenly find that the other adventurers have all quietly taken a couple of steps back, leaving you out in the front. 
"Splendid", chortles Gilgern before you can say anything, "We've one brave soul willing to risk their all for our little cause. Welcome, stranger..." 
Before you know it, you have been whisked away from the town square in a donkey and cart and deposited beside a track. 
"Good luck - you'll need it!" calls the driver over his shoulder, as he hurries away. 

Welcome to Dragon Adventure. You start your quest on a mountain path in the North-East...

Dragon Adventure
A simple text adventure for players aged 9 and over, by William Stott
Release 2 / Serial number 040211 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 

Rocky Mountains
It is a clear, bright morning and all seems peaceful. A tiny sparrowhawk wheels and soars lazily in the cool empty air above. There is a steep pathway to the south leading down into dense woodland, and you can make out an old building by the path. In the distance you can just glimpse the steel-grey of the sea, far away to the west. 

You can go north, south, east or west.

Thought 2: Based on the observation, it seems like I am in the Rocky Mountains and there are different directions I can go. I should explore the old building to the south first, as it might contain useful items or information.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Go south]

Observation 2:
Abandoned Inn
An old, thatched building stands near the path. It seems to be an abandoned inn or tavern, as a faded sign reads 'Troll's Arms'. The walls are a dirty white and the paintwork is starting to peel and blister. The windows are covered in cobwebs and there is the faint odour of mildew and decay. Weeds grow between the flagstones of the path leading up to the door, which leans open. No-one seems to have lived here for years. A path leads north into the mountains and there seems to be some swampy ground to the west. 

You can go north (to the mountains), west (towards a swamp) or east (into the inn).

Thought 3: It seems like exploring the abandoned inn to the east might yield some useful items or information. I will go inside and take a look around.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation 3:
Inside the Inn
There are a few patches of mould on the walls and the floorboards creak slightly, but the building seems safe enough. As you move you disturb a thin layer of dust. There are some stone steps leading down, and an open doorway to the outside to the west. You see some tables and chairs. There is a dark, intricately-carved wooden chair in the corner behind you. 

You can go west (back outside) or down some steps.

You can see a magnificently carved chair here.

Thought 4: It seems like there is a carved chair in the corner that might be valuable or have a purpose. I should investigate it more closely.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine chair]

Observation 4: You see the back of one chair is covered with fine carvings...

Thought 5: It seems like the chair has some intricate carvings on it. I should take a closer look at the carvings to see if there's anything significant about them.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine carvings]

Observation 5:
There is a carving of a goblin... 
He seems to be holding something...

Thought 6: It seems like the carving on the chair back depicts a goblin holding something. I should try to make out what the goblin is holding, as it might be a clue or an item of interest.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine goblin]

Observation 6:
The goblin seems to be blowing a hunting horn... 
Wait a minute... 
There is a dragon carved next to the goblin!

Thought 7: It seems like the goblin is blowing a hunting horn and there is a dragon carved next to it. This could be a clue about how to defeat the dragon. I should take note of this information for later reference.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[Note 'goblin blowing horn near dragon']

Observation 7: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 8: It seems like the game doesn't recognize "Note" as a valid command. I should find another way to remember this information for later reference. I can use the "Remember" command instead.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[Remember 'goblin blowing horn near dragon']

Observation 8: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 9: It seems like the game doesn't support the "Remember" command. I will have to rely on my own memory to recall the information about the goblin blowing a horn near a dragon. For now, I should continue exploring the inn and see if there are any other useful items or clues.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation 9:
Abandoned Inn
An old, thatched building stands near the path. It seems to be an abandoned inn or tavern, as a faded sign reads 'Troll's Arms'. The walls are a dirty white and the paintwork is starting to peel and blister. The windows are covered in cobwebs and there is the faint odour of mildew and decay. Weeds grow between the flagstones of the path leading up to the door, which leans open. No-one seems to have lived here for years. A path leads north into the mountains and there seems to be some swampy ground to the west. 

You can go north (to the mountains), west (towards a swamp) or east (into the inn).

Thought 10: It seems like I have returned to the entrance of the abandoned inn. I should explore the swampy ground to the west, as it might contain useful items or information.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation 10:
Swampy Ground
Water seeps around the soles of your boots and fills your recent footprints. You can hear the croaking of frogs and the occasional bubble of marsh-gas coming to the surface. There is an abandoned inn to the east, and a path leads south into the forest. To the west there seems to be a little country road. 

You can go south (along a forest path), east (towards an inn) or west (towards a road).

A little man comes up to you and asks if you want to buy a box.
You can see a little man and a large cardboard box here.

Thought 11: It seems like there is a little man offering to sell me a box. I should talk to him and see if he has any useful information or items. If the box contains something useful, I can consider buying it.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[Talk to little man]

Observation 11: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 12: It seems like the game doesn't recognize "Talk" as a valid command. I should try a different approach to interact with the little man. I can use the "Ask" command instead.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[Ask little man about box]

Observation 12: There is no reply.

Thought 13: It seems like the little man is not responding to my question. He might not be programmed to respond to player interactions. In that case, I should focus on exploring the swampy ground and see if there are any useful items or clues.

Action 13: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation 13:
You can't. The little man won't let you. 
He wants you to buy the box.

Thought 14: It seems like the little man won't let me pass unless I buy the box. I should consider buying the box if it contains something useful. However, I should first check if I have enough money to purchase it.

Action 14: InteractiveFictionGame[Check inventory]

Observation 14: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 15: It seems like the game doesn't support the "Check inventory" command. In that case, I should assume that I have enough money to buy the box and proceed with the purchase.

Action 15: InteractiveFictionGame[Buy box]

Observation 15: You have no money...

Thought 16: It seems like I don't have enough money to buy the box. I should look for other ways to obtain money or useful items. For now, I will continue exploring the swampy ground and see if there are any other useful items or clues.

Action 16: InteractiveFictionGame[Go south]

Observation 16:
You can't. The little man won't let you. 
He wants you to buy the box.

Thought 17: It seems like the little man is still blocking my way and insisting that I buy the box. Since I don't have enough money and the game doesn't support checking my inventory, I can't proceed with the purchase. Therefore, I will try to find another way around the swampy ground and continue exploring.

Action 17: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation 17:

A path leads north into the mountains and there seems to be some swampy ground to the west. 

You can go north (to the mountains), west (towards a swamp) or east (into the inn).

Thought 18: It seems like I have returned to the entrance of the abandoned inn. I should explore the mountains to the north, as it might contain useful items or information.

Action 18: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation 18:
Rocky Mountains
It is a clear, bright morning and all seems peaceful. A tiny sparrowhawk wheels and soars lazily in the cool empty air above. There is a steep pathway to the south leading down into dense woodland, and you can make out an old building by the path. In the distance you can just glimpse the steel-grey of the sea, far away to the west. 

You can go north, south, east or west.

Thought 19: It seems like I have come full circle and returned to the starting point in the Rocky Mountains. I have explored the abandoned inn and the swampy ground, but I haven't found any useful items or clues yet. I should continue exploring the mountains and see if there are any other paths or clues that I missed.

You can go north, south, east or west.

Thought 20: It seems like going east from the starting point in the Rocky Mountains just leads me back to the same location. I have explored the abandoned inn and the swampy ground, but I haven't found any useful items or clues yet. I should try going north or west from the starting point and see if there are any other paths or clues that I missed.

Thought 22: It seems like going west from the starting point in the Rocky Mountains just leads me back to the same location. I have explored the abandoned inn and the swampy ground, but I haven't found any useful items or clues yet. I should consider revisiting previous locations or trying different actions to see if I can uncover any hidden details or items.

Action 22: InteractiveFictionGame[Go south]

Observation 22:

A path leads north into the mountains and there seems to be some swampy ground to the west. 

You can go north (to the mountains), west (towards a swamp) or east (into the inn).

Thought 23: I have already explored the abandoned inn to the east, and there didn't seem to be anything useful there. I should try exploring the swampy ground to the west instead.

Action 23: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

You can go south (along a forest path), east (towards an inn) or west (towards a road).

You can see a little man and a large cardboard box here.

Thought 24: I have already encountered the little man and his box before, and I couldn't buy it due to lack of money. I should continue exploring the swampy ground and see if there are any other useful items or clues.

Action 24: InteractiveFictionGame[Go south]

Observation 24:
You can't. The little man won't let you. 
He wants you to buy the box.
