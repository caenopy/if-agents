You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: a response provided by the game based on the previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'] or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start by taking the 'Start' action to begin the game. Based on the observation from this action, I will determine the next steps to take.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[Check Inventory]

Observation 4: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 5: I don't have any items in my inventory that could help me deal with the dragon. I should avoid the dragon for now and continue exploring. I will go west and observe the result.

Thought 10: I have reached the lakeside and found several interesting objects. There is a golden fish in the water, a rusty axe with a magic word "BUNYON" on it, and a sign that forbids swimming. I should examine these objects more closely to see if they can be useful. I will check the golden fish and observe the result.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[Check Golden Fish]

Observation 10: You see nothing special about the *GOLDEN FISH*.

Thought 11: The golden fish doesn't seem to have any special properties, so I will move on to the rusty axe. I will check the rusty axe and observe the result.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[Check Rusty Axe]

Observation 11: The magic word BUNYON is written on the haft.

Thought 12: The rusty axe has a magic word "BUNYON" written on it, which might be useful in the future. I don't see any obvious use for it right now, so I will continue exploring. I will go down and observe the result.

Bog
You're in a quick-sand bog.

Obvious exits: none!

Action 13: InteractiveFictionGame[Check Statue]

Observation 13: You see nothing special about the *SMALL STATUE OF A BLUE OX*.

Thought 14: The statue doesn't seem to have any special properties. I should focus on finding a way out of the bog. I remember seeing a magic word "BUNYON" on the rusty axe. Maybe it can help me here. I will try using the magic word and observe the result.

Action 14: InteractiveFictionGame[Say BUNYON]

Observation 14:
(to yourself)
There is no reply.

Thought 15: Saying the magic word "BUNYON" alone did not have any effect. I should try using it in a command. I will try using the magic word with the rusty axe and observe the result.

Action 15: InteractiveFictionGame[Use BUNYON with axe]

Observation 15: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 16: It seems that I cannot use the magic word "BUNYON" directly with the rusty axe. I should try using it as a verb. I will try using the rusty axe with the magic word and observe the result.

Action 16: InteractiveFictionGame[Use axe with BUNYON]

Observation 16: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 17: I am unable to use the magic word "BUNYON" with the rusty axe as a verb either. I will try using the rusty axe as a tool to get out of the bog and observe the result.

Observation 20: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 21: It seems that moving around in the bog is not an option. I have tried using the rusty axe in various ways, but I have not been successful. I will try using the magic word "BUNYON" in a different way and observe the result.

Action 21: InteractiveFictionGame[Say BUNYON]

Observation 21:
(to yourself)
There is no reply.

Thought 22: Saying the magic word "BUNYON" alone did not have any effect. I should try using it in a command related to the rusty axe. I will try using the magic word with "use" as a verb and observe the result.

Action 22: InteractiveFictionGame[Use BUNYON]

Observation 22: That's not a verb I recognise.

A voice booms out...
Try:  LOOK,JUMP,SWIM,CLIMB,THROW,FIND,GO,TAKE,INVENTORY,SCORE.
You may need magic words here.

Thought 25: The "help" command suggests trying the "jump" command. I will try using the "jump" command and observe the result.

Action 25: InteractiveFictionGame[Jump]

Observation 25: You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.

Thought 26: Jumping on the spot did not help me escape the bog. The "help" command also suggested trying the "swim" command. However, there is a sign near the lakeside that forbids swimming. Therefore, it might not be a good idea to try swimming in the bog. I will try using the "climb" command and observe the result.

Action 26: InteractiveFictionGame[Climb]

Observation 26:
(the *SMALL STATUE OF A BLUE OX*)
I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

Thought 27: It seems that climbing the statue is not an option. The "help" command also suggested trying the "find" command. I will try using the "find" command and observe the result.

Action 27: InteractiveFictionGame[Find]

Observation 27:
A voice booms out...
Find it yourself.

Thought 28: The game's response to the "find" command suggests that I need to figure out how to find a way out on my own.

Thought 31: It seems that going up is not an option. I have tried using the rusty axe and the magic word "BUNYON" in various ways, but I have not been successful. I have also tried going in different directions, but none of them have led me to a way out. At this point, I am stuck in the bog with no clear way out. I will try using the "take" command to see if I can take the small statue of a blue ox and observe the result.

Action 31: InteractiveFictionGame[Take Statue]

At this point, I am stuck in the bog with no clear way out. I will try using the "score" command to see if it provides any useful information and observe the result.

Action 34: InteractiveFictionGame[Score]

Observation 34: You have so far scored 0 out of a possible 100, in 22 turns.

I have tried using the rusty axe and the magic word "BUNYON" in various ways, but I have not been successful. I have also tried going in different directions, taking the small statue of a blue ox, and checking my inventory, but none of these actions have led me to a way out. At this point, I am stuck in the bog with no clear way out. However, I have only used 22 turns so far, so I still have a chance to explore and find a solution. I will continue to explore the game and look for any clues or items that might help me escape the bog and increase my score.
