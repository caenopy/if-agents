You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: a response provided by the game based on the previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'] or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start by taking the 'Start' action to begin the game. Based on the observation from this action, I will determine the next steps to take.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.

Void
You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner.

Thought 2: It seems I am in a dream-like world, filled with hazy objects and strange colors. I will explore a bit and try to get a sense of my surroundings.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around]

Observation 2: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought 3: It seems I need to be more specific when giving commands. I will try using a more specific action to look around.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine surroundings]

Observation 3: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 4: It seems like the game doesn't understand the command "Examine surroundings". I will try a more specific action.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[Look at the hazy objects]

Observation 4:
They are sometimes stationary, sometimes moving around. Their movement is not linear and they seem to suddenly dissolve from one place, only to appear from nothing in a new place, apparently at random. Although they sometimes are close to you they always appear hazy.

A cascade of red colour explodes below you.

Thought 5: It seems like the hazy objects are moving around in a random manner. I will try to move around and see if I can interact with them in any way.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[Go south]

Observation 5:
You move, or rather you come to a new place. The concept of body and movement seems different here.

Void
This new location is not much different from the one you came from. The shadows are still moving around at random through the abyss, reverberating with strange sounds and coloured light.

Suddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long.

Thought 6: It seems like there is a new element in my dream that causes a sense of fear. I will try to avoid it and see if I can find any clues or objects that might be useful.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[Move away from the fearful shape]

Observation 6: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 7: It seems like the game doesn't understand the command "Move away from the fearful shape". I will try to use a more specific direction to move away from the shape.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation 7:
In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.

The shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.

Roof
The city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star-filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down.

Thought 8: It seems like I have managed to move to a new location, a roof of an ancient tower. I will explore this location and try to find any clues or objects that might be useful.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the roof]

Observation 8: Judging from the masonry the tower must be centuries old. It towers high above the nightmarish city below.

Thought 9: It seems like the roof is an ancient tower that is centuries old. There doesn't seem to be anything of interest here at the moment. I will explore the city below and see if I can find any clues or objects that might be useful.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[Go down the staircase]

Observation 9: I only understood you as far as wanting to go the floor.

Thought 10: It seems I need to be more specific when giving commands to go down the staircase. I will try using a more specific action to go down the staircase.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[Go down the winding staircase]

Observation 10: I only understood you as far as wanting to go the floor.

Thought 11: It seems like the game doesn't understand the command "Go down the winding staircase". I will try to use a more specific action to go down the staircase.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[Walk down the winding staircase]

Observation 11: I only understood you as far as wanting to walk the floor.

Thought 12: It seems like the game doesn't understand the command "Walk down the winding staircase" either. I will try to use a simpler action to go down the staircase.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[Go down]

Observation 12:
The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.

Study
Dust and spider webs cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam, blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic, dreamy forms. The walls are lined with bookshelves and a lone desk lies at one corner. Close to a staircase, which leads further up and down the tower, is a massive table made of black stone. A doorway leads to a smaller room to the south.

On the desk is a yellow paper.

Thought 13: It seems like I have successfully gone down the staircase and entered a study. There is a yellow paper on the desk that might contain useful information. I will examine the yellow paper.

Action 13: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the yellow paper]

Observation 13: On the paper is a coded message and it is impossible to say even in which language the text is written.

Thought 14: It seems like the yellow paper contains a coded message that I can't decipher at the moment. I will explore the study some more and see if I can find any clues or objects that might be useful.

Action 14: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the bookshelves]

Observation 14: The bookshelves are  filled with bound volumes that are crumbling with age.

Thought 15: It seems like the bookshelves contain old, crumbling books which might not be useful at the moment. I will explore the other parts of the study and see if I can find any clues or objects that might be useful.

Action 15: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the massive table made of black stone]

Observation 15: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 16: It seems like the game doesn't understand the command "Examine the massive table made of black stone". I will try to use a more specific action to examine the table.

Action 16: InteractiveFictionGame[Look at the black stone table]

Observation 16:
The base of the stone table is covered with carvings, each showing different kinds of creatures, or maybe Gods, standing on stone tables. Humans, who seem to be reciting prayers or spells, are standing in front of the creatures.

You spot something behind the table. Pushing the cobwebs aside, you reveal some writing, crudely painted on the stone wall with black paint.

Thought 17: It seems like the black stone table has carvings of creatures or Gods standing on stone tables, with humans in front of them. There is also some writing on the stone wall behind the table. I will examine the writing on the stone wall.

Action 17: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the writing on the stone wall]

Observation 17: I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the writing.

Thought 18: It seems like the game doesn't understand the command "Examine the writing on the stone wall". I will try to use a more specific action to examine the writing.

Action 18: InteractiveFictionGame[Read the writing on the stone wall]

Observation 18: I only understood you as far as wanting to read the writing.

Thought 19: It seems like the game doesn't understand the command "Read the writing on the stone wall" either. I will try to describe my action more clearly.

Action 19: InteractiveFictionGame[Carefully read the crudely painted writing on the stone wall behind the black stone table]

Observation 19: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 20: It seems like the game doesn't recognize the verb "Carefully" in my command. I will remove it and try again.

Action 20: InteractiveFictionGame[Read the crudely painted writing on the stone wall behind the black stone table]

Observation 20: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 21: It seems like the game doesn't understand the command "Read the crudely painted writing on the stone wall behind the black stone table" either. I will try to move closer to the wall and then read the writing.

Action 21: InteractiveFictionGame[Move closer to the stone wall]

Observation 21: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 22: It seems like the game doesn't understand the command "Move closer to the stone wall". I will try to use a more specific direction to move closer to the wall.

Action 22: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west to the stone wall]

Observation 22: I only understood you as far as wanting to go the west wall.

Thought 23: It seems like the game doesn't understand the command "Go west to the stone wall". I will try to use a simpler action to move closer to the wall.

Action 23: InteractiveFictionGame[Move closer]

Observation 23: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 24: It seems like the game doesn't understand the command "Move closer" either. I will try to examine the wall to see if I can read the writing.

Action 24: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the stone wall]

Observation 24: I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the black stone table.

Thought 25: It seems like the game still doesn't understand the command "Examine the stone wall". I will try to use a more specific action to examine the wall.

Action 25: InteractiveFictionGame[Look at the stone wall]

Observation 25: I only understood you as far as wanting to look at the black stone table.

Thought 26: It seems like the game is unable to recognize the stone wall as a separate entity. I will try to describe the action in a way that specifies the location of the wall relative to me.

Action 26: InteractiveFictionGame[Look at the wall behind the black stone table]

Observation 26: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 27: It seems like the game doesn't understand the command "Look at the wall behind the black stone table". At this point, I'm not sure how to help you read the writing on the stone wall. I will try to go back to the previous location and see if I can find any other clues or objects that might be useful.

Action 27: InteractiveFictionGame[Go up the staircase]

Observation 27: I only understood you as far as wanting to go the ceiling.

Thought 28: It seems like the game doesn't understand the command "Go up the staircase". I will try to use a more specific action to go up the staircase.

Action 28: InteractiveFictionGame[Climb up the staircase]

Observation 28:
Hall
This damp hall occupies the whole ground level of the tower. A staircase provides access to the higher levels, while a massive oak door, set in the southern wall, leads out.

Thought 29: It seems like I have successfully climbed up the staircase and entered a damp hall. There is a massive oak door to the south that might lead to new areas. I will examine the oak door.

Action 29: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the oak door]

Observation 29: The door is big and made of crude oak logs, which have darkened to almost black with time and wear. The lock and the iron handle look handcrafted and antique.

Thought 30: It seems like the oak door is made of old, darkened oak logs with an antique lock and handle. It might be possible to open it with a key or by manipulating the lock. I will try to open the door.

Action 30: InteractiveFictionGame[Open the oak door]

Observation 30: You press the handle and try to open the door, but find that it won't budge.

Thought 31: It seems like the door is locked and cannot be opened easily. I will look around the hall and see if I can find any clues or objects that might help me open the door.

Action 31: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the hall]

Observation 31: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 32: It seems like the game doesn't understand the command "Examine the hall". I will try to be more specific in my action.

Action 35: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the staircase]

Observation 35: The steps are uncomfortably high, and seem to have been designed for someone much taller than you.

Thought 36: It seems like the staircase is not standard size and might be designed for someone taller. There doesn't seem to be anything useful here at the moment. I will examine the massive oak door again and see if there are any new details that I missed before.

Action 36: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the oak door]

Observation 36: The door is big and made of crude oak logs, which have darkened to almost black with time and wear. The lock and the iron handle look handcrafted and antique.

Thought 37: It seems like the oak door is still locked and cannot be opened easily. I don't see any obvious way to open it at the moment. I will explore the rest of the tower and see if I can find any other clues or objects that might be useful. If I can't find anything, I may need to try and decipher the coded message on the yellow paper to see if it contains any information about opening the door.

Action 37: InteractiveFictionGame[Go up the staircase]

Observation 37: I only understood you as far as wanting to go the ceiling.

Thought 38: It seems like the game doesn't understand the command "Go up the staircase" when I'm already at the top of the staircase. I will try to go down the staircase instead and explore the lower levels of the tower.

Thought 47: It seems like I'm stuck in a loop while trying to explore the hallway. I will try to go back to the study and see if I can find any other clues or objects that might be useful. If I can't find anything, I may need to try and decipher the coded message on the yellow paper to see if it contains any information about opening the door.

Action 47: InteractiveFictionGame[Go up the staircase]
