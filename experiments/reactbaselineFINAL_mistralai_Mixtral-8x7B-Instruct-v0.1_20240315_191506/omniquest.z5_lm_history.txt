You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: a response provided by the game based on the previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'] or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start by taking the 'Start' action to begin the game. Based on the observation from this action, I will determine the next steps to take.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
OMNIQuest
A POP Release
Parser Version 1.0
POP RULES!!

There's nothing to do, and you're sort of tired, so you lay on your bed and think philosophical thoughts.
(meaning of life, end of the world, etc.)  As you philosophize, you begin to doze...

You wake up with a horrible headache.  As you glance around, you realize that you are not in Kansas anymore.
You attempt to gain some bearing as to where you are...

Large Clearing
You are standing in a large clearing surrounded by a dense forest.  There is a path to the east.

You can see a tree here.

Thought 2: Now that I have started the game and observed the initial environment, I can see that I am in a large clearing surrounded by a dense forest with a path to the east. There is also a tree present. Given that there are no immediate threats or objectives mentioned, I will explore the path to the east to see where it leads.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation 2:
Small Path
The path branches here.  There are paths to the west and south that continue into the forest.  The path to the east appears to lead into some rather rocky territory.

Thought 3: Now that I have explored the path to the east and found that it leads to some rocky territory, I will turn my attention to the other paths. I will first explore the path to the west, as it is one of the two remaining options.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation 3:
Large Clearing

You can see a tree here.

Thought 4: Now that I have explored the path to the west and found myself in another large clearing, I will turn my attention to the remaining path. I will explore the path to the south, as it is the last unexplored option.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[Go south]

Observation 4: You can't go that way.

Thought 5: Now that I have explored the path to the west and found myself in another large clearing, and tried to go south but couldn't, I will return to the previous location and explore the path to the east. It's possible that the rocky terrain may contain something of interest.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation 5: Small Path

Thought 6: Now that I have returned to the small path, I will explore the path to the east, as it is the only unexplored option remaining.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation 6:
Canyon Entrance
This is the entrance to a canyon formed by an ancient river.  The canyon is to the east.  There is a sandy path to the northwest that seems to lead to a beach.  There is a path leading into a forest to the west.

Thought 7: Now that I have reached the canyon entrance, I can see that there are two new paths available: one leading into the canyon to the east, and another leading to a beach to the northwest. I will first explore the path to the northwest, as it is the closer of the two options.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[Go northwest]

Observation 7:
Endless Beach
This is a beach that seems to stretch on forever to the east and west.  There is nothing particularly notable about the beach, except that it has white sand.  The ocean is to the north.  You see an island on the horizon.  There is a path winding across the dunes to the southeast.

Thought 8: Now that I have reached the endless beach, I can see that there is a path winding across the dunes to the southeast. I will explore this path, as it is the only unexplored option remaining.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[Go southeast]

Observation 8: Canyon Entrance

Thought 9: Now that I have returned to the canyon entrance, I can see that I have completed exploring all available paths from the initial large clearing. I will now consider revisiting previous locations to see if there are any hidden objects or interactions that I missed. I will start by going back to the endless beach, as it had the most notable feature - an island on the horizon.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation 9: You can't go that way.

Thought 10: Now that I have reached the edge of the ocean and cannot go north, I will return to the canyon entrance and explore the path leading into the canyon to the east.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation 10:
Canyon Path
The path here is a riverbed that has long since gone dry.  The river has cut several meandering passages into the canyon, forming what looks like two rather large boulders.  A passage to the north appears to go around the larger boulder, while a narrow gap to the southeast seems to go around the smaller boulder.  A passage to the east cuts the rock into its separate sections.  And of course, the passage to the west goes back the way you came.

Thought 11: Now that I have entered the canyon, I can see that there are multiple paths available. I will first explore the passage to the north, as it is the closest option.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation 11:
Small Clearing
This clearing is apparently a brief widening of some ancient river.  There are various small passages winding around two large boulders.  These are to the north, south, and west.

You can see a shovel here.

Thought 12: Now that I have explored the passage to the north and found a small clearing with a shovel, I will pick up the shovel to add it to my inventory.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[Take shovel]

Thought 13: Now that I have picked up the shovel, I will return to the previous location and explore the narrow gap to the southeast, as it is the only unexplored option remaining.

From there, I will retrace my steps back to the beach, as it had the most notable feature - an island on the horizon. I will then explore the beach area more thoroughly, keeping an eye out for anything unusual or interactive.
