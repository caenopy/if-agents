(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Observation: game observation based on previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

CandidateActions: A short list (at least 1 but not more than 5) of valid candidate actions to take based on the last observation and thought, for example '[InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south]]'. Each action is a few words using only simple verbs and nouns present in the environment from previous observations formatted as 'InteractiveFictionGame[<action>]

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation: This has never been your favorite part of the city.  Nor is this neighborhood the safest one.  But as a city sanitarian, you are charged with completing an annual health and safety inspection of every restaurant in your district.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street and my task is to inspect the restaurant for health code violations. I will start by entering the restaurant and taking a look around. I will also examine the placard on the front door and the newspaper on the curb.

Observation:
19th Street
You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street.  A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room.  The front entrance is north of you.

Reflect: After reflecting on my progress, I realize that I need to find a way to unlock the front door of the restaurant. I will examine the placard on the front door more closely to see if it provides any clues or instructions. I will also check my inventory to see if I have any tools or objects that might help me unlock the door. If I still can't find a way to unlock the door, I will look for another entrance or exit.

19th Street West
You are walking past the window to Goldschmidt's Pawnshop (on the north side of 19th Street).  Although the shop is closed right now, the window provides a neat display of hocked merchandise.  Nikolai's Bar and Grill is east.  To the west, the neighborhood becomes even seedier.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am on 19th Street and I see a pawnshop to the north and Nikolai's Bar and Grill to the east. The pawnshop is closed and the door is locked. I will consider my options and decide on the best course of action. I could try to find another way to enter Nikolai's, or I could try to find the owner of the pawnshop to see if they have a key to the restaurant.

Observation: You read: (in big red letters) CLOSED

Reflect: After reflecting on my progress, I realize that the placard on the front door of Nikolai's Bar and Grill says "CLOSED" in big red letters. This suggests that the restaurant is currently closed and I may not be able to enter or inspect it at this time. I will consider my options and decide on the best course of action.
