You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Follow the following format.

Observation: game observation based on previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

CandidateActions: A short list (at least 1 but not more than 5) of valid candidate actions to take based on the last observation and thought, for example '[InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south]]'. Each action is a few words using only simple verbs and nouns present in the environment from previous observations formatted as 'InteractiveFictionGame[<action>]

Action: choose one of the valid actions provided in CandidateActions, or, when done, Finish[answer]

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation: Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am in a pizza parlor where I work as a delivery person. There is nothing urgent that I can think of at the moment. I will explore the parlor to see if there is anything interesting or important that I should attend to. I will also keep an eye out for any items that might be useful.

Pizza Parlor
You are standing in the middle of "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor". The counter separating you from the back of the parlor stretches in front of you on the northeast corner of the room. To the south is an exit to the street.

Thought: Based on the observation, there is nothing urgent that I can think of at the moment. However, I notice that there is a counter in the middle of the room and I have a feeling that I am forgetting to do something important related to it. I will go to the counter and examine it more closely.

Observation:
Street, by Pizza Parlor
San Doppleton is where you live, work and play -- at least until summer. It has the typical California culture; which is to say, none. But at least it's just forty minutes' drive from Santa Barbara and the beach, so you can't complain much.

Thought: Based on the observation, I have exited the pizza parlor and am now on the main street of San Doppleton. My task is to deliver a pizza to Mr. Calzone at the San Doppleton Courthouse. I will look for landmarks to help me find my way to the courthouse.
