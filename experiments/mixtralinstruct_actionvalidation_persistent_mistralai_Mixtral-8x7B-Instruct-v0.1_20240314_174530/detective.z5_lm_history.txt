Release 1 / Serial number 000715 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 SD

<< Chief's office >>
You are standing in the Chief's office. He is telling you "The Mayor was murdered yeaterday night at 12:03 am. I want you to solve it before we get any bad publicity or the FBI has to come in. "Yessir!" You reply. He hands you a sheet of paper. Once you have read it, go north or west.

You can see a piece of white paper here.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

Thought: Based on the observation, I am in the Chief's office and have been tasked with solving a murder. The Chief has given me some information, which I assume is on the piece of white paper. I will read the paper to gather more information. I have two choices for exiting the room: north or west. I don't have enough information yet to determine which direction would be best, so I will read the paper first.

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFictionGame[Read the paper]]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Read the paper]

CONFIDENTIAL:

He has worked hard on this so you better enjoy it.
I did have fun making it though. But I'd REALLY appreciate it if you were kind enough to send a postcard or... dare I even say it?... money... to:

Just tell me if you like it or not.
If you want to talk to me over a BBS call the Ghostbuster Central BBS at (510)208-5657.
There is an Exile Games file area. Have fun. I WILL give hints out over the BBS to any of my games.

Thought: Based on the observation, the paper I read does not contain any information relevant to the murder case. I will now decide which direction to go. I can go north or west from the Chief's office. I don't have any information yet that would suggest which direction is better, but going west leads to a "dark alley," while going north continues on to the "street." Since the street is a more open and public area, I will go north to start my investigation.

Observation:

Thought: Based on the observation, I am now outside on the street. It is cold and there is a dead end to the east and the rest of the street to the west. There is no indication of any relevance to the murder case here, so I will explore the rest of the street to see if I can find any clues or leads.

Reflect: After reflecting on my progress and strategy, I think I have been making good decisions so far. I started the game and read the paper to gather more information. I then decided to go north from the Chief's office, as the street seemed like a more open and public area to start my investigation. I am now on the street and have the option to go to the Mayor's home to the east or a restaurant to the north where the Mayor ate often. I will choose to go to the Mayor's home first, as it may contain clues or leads related to the murder case.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am now in the dining room of the Mayor's house. I can see a note on the table, and I will examine it to see if it contains any relevant information.

We have acclaimed Justice! The Justice of the future! Our next hit is the governer! You CAN'T STOP US! The note sounds like the killers are a group and that they are vigilantes (look it up). You are now getting a bit worried.

Thought: Based on the observation, the note I found in the dining room contains a threatening message from the killers, claiming responsibility for the Mayor's murder and announcing their next target, the Governor. They also mention that they are a group of vigilantes. This information is crucial to the case, and I should inform the Chief immediately.

I have read the note to myself, but I need to find a way to inform the Chief about the threat to the Governor and the vigilante group.

Observation:
<< Hallway >>
You are still in the hallway. You can go north to where there is a police officer who will let you outside, or you can go east or west.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am still in the hallway. I have explored the rooms to the west and east, but they were both closets with nothing of interest. I can go north to where there is a police officer who will let me outside, or I can go east or west. I should try to find the Chief's office, so I will go north and see if there is anything interesting in that direction.

Observation:
<< Outside >>
You pass the guard. He nods at you. You are now outside standing on the street. You can go north and east, your choice. To the north is more of the street, and to the east is a video store.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

Thought: Based on the observation, I am now outside the Mayor's house and can go north or east. Going north will take me to more of the street, while going east will take me to a video store. I don't have any reason to believe that the Chief's office is in the video store, but I should continue exploring to make sure. I will try going east and see if there is anything interesting in that direction.

Reflect: After reflecting on my progress and strategy, I think I have been making good decisions so far. I started the game and read the paper to gather more information. I then decided to go north from the Chief's office, as the street seemed like a more open and public area to start my investigation. I am now at the scene of the crime, the Mayor's house, and have explored the living room and dining room, taking note of any relevant clues or items. I have picked up a battered piece of wood and a note, and I will examine them more closely to see if they are related to the murder case. I have informed the Chief about the threat to the Governor and the vigilante group, but I am currently lost in the Mayor's house and need to find my way back to the Chief's office.

Thought: I need to find my way back to the Chief's office in order to continue investigating the murder case. I can try using the 'examine' or 'look' command to get a better sense of my surroundings and find any landmarks that might help me navigate. I can also try using cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) to help me keep track of my location.

Instead, I should try going north and see if there is anything interesting in that direction.
