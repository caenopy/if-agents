You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: game observation based on previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

CandidateActions: A short list (at least 1 but not more than 5) of valid candidate actions to take based on the last observation and thought, for example '[InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south]]'. Each action is a few words using only simple verbs and nouns present in the environment from previous observations formatted as 'InteractiveFictionGame[<action>]

Action: choose one of the valid actions provided in CandidateActions, or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Large Clearing
You are standing in a large clearing surrounded by a dense forest.  There is a path to the east.

You can see a tree here.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am in a large clearing surrounded by a dense forest with a path to the east. There is also a tree present. My goal is to explore the game and its mechanics, gather information about my surroundings and objectives, and collect useful items. Therefore, I will take the path to the east and explore in that direction.

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFictionGame[go east]]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation:
Small Path
The path branches here.  There are paths to the west and south that continue into the forest.  The path to the east appears to lead into some rather rocky territory.

Thought: Based on the new observation, I am now at a path that branches to the west, south, and east. The path to the east seems to lead to some rocky territory. My goal is still to explore the game and its mechanics, gather information about my surroundings and objectives, and collect useful items. I will first explore the path to the west, as it is the closest one to me.
