In it, you see some pease porridge.\n\nSuddenly, from the corner of your eye, you glimpse a streak of moth-eaten fur hurtling toward you from the forest! Your heart races, yet you stand paralyzed with fear; your mind screams at your unresponsive body to flee. Run! Run for your life!\n\nToo late. Alas, too late.\n\n\"Boo!\" snarls a big, bad wolf, who is huffing and puffing from all the exertion. His eyes narrow into slits as he studies you closely. \"Hey, wait just a minute! You ain't Little Red Riding Hood.\"\n\nThe wolf loiters in the area, keeping an eye on you.",
