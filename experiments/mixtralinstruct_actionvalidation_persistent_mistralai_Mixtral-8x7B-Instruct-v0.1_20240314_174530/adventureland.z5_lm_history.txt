You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Follow the following format.

Observation: game observation based on previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

CandidateActions: A short list (at least 1 but not more than 5) of valid candidate actions to take based on the last observation and thought, for example '[InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south]]'. Each action is a few words using only simple verbs and nouns present in the environment from previous observations formatted as 'InteractiveFictionGame[<action>]

Action: choose one of the valid actions provided in CandidateActions, or, when done, Finish[answer]

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers.

I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

There is also some vegetation in the form of trees. I don't have any specific objectives yet, so I will start by exploring the area and seeing what I can find.
