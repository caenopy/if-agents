You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Follow the following format.

Observation: game observation based on previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

CandidateActions: A short list (at least 1 but not more than 5) of valid candidate actions to take based on the last observation and thought, for example '[InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south]]'. Each action is a few words using only simple verbs and nouns present in the environment from previous observations formatted as 'InteractiveFictionGame[<action>]

Action: choose one of the valid actions provided in CandidateActions, or, when done, Finish[answer]

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation: No, not a prison, though stone stands around you, as expressionless as a mirror awaiting face and form; and in the silence you hear no plaint of flute or roar of gong, but instead the crash of porcelain shattering. 

Thought: It seems that I have started the game and found myself in a chamber with moonlight shining through the walls. There is a spiral staircase leading downwards and a porcelain mask present in the room. I will take the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Take porcelain mask]' to add the mask to my inventory.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[look]

Observation:
Moonlit Chamber
Moonlight diffuses through the walls, tracing out unreadable sigils in calligraphies of light and dark. Stairs adorned with bas-relief motifs spiral downward.

Thought: Based on my previous observations, I am in a chamber with moonlight shining through the walls, creating unreadable sigils on the walls.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go down]

Observation:
Shadow Armory
Shadows gather around you. For a moment, dregs of light defined by the negative space take on the shapes of maple leaf, kite, comb, and other shapes that flicker across the walls too rapidly for you to interpret.

Reflect: Thought: I have descended the stairs and found myself in a new room called the Shadow Armory. The room is dark, with shadows taking on various shapes. The only weapons here are silhouettes flung against the walls, and stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward. There are also two passageways to the north and west. I will explore the passageways and see where they lead.

Thought: I have entered the northward passageway and found myself in a new room. I will explore the room and see what I can find.

Curiously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.

Thought: Based on my previous observations, I am in the Shadow Armory, where the only weapons are silhouettes flung against the walls. There are stairs carved with bas-reliefs that spiral upward, and two passageways to the north and west. I have not yet explored the westward passageway, so I will do so now.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go west]

Observation: The shapes of light you saw as you entered fade irrevocably.

Thought: I have entered the "Silent Symphony" room, which contains a bronze gong and silk cushions arranged in a traditional half-circle. There are also two entrances, one to the east and one to the north. The eastern entrance is wrapped in shadow, while the northern entrance is wrapped in light. I will explore the room further and examine the gong.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go east]

Observation:
Shadow Armory
Curiously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.

Reflect: Thought: I have moved back to the Shadow Armory. I must have accidentally moved back to this room while trying to examine the eastern entrance in the Silent Symphony room. I will try moving west again to return to the Silent Symphony room and then examine the eastern entrance.

Thought: I have successfully returned to the Silent Symphony room. I will now examine the eastern entrance.

There are stairs carved with bas-reliefs that spiral upward, and two passageways to the north and west. I have explored the westward passageway, which led me to the Silent Symphony room, but I was unable to examine the eastern entrance in that room. I will now explore the northward passageway and see where it leads.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go north]

Observation:
Undying Garden
Barren branches and pines suggest winter's quiet. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.

Reflect: Thought: I have entered the "Undying Garden" and found a jade compass at its metaphysical center. The compass emits a gentle warmth and invites touch. There are also two exits to the south and west. I will examine the compass and see if it provides any clues about where to go next.

Thought: I have entered the "Undying Garden" and found a jade compass at its metaphysical center. The compass emits a gentle warmth and invites touch. There are also two exits to the south and west. The compass may be a useful tool for navigation, so I will examine it more closely.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine jade compass]

Observation: The compass is carved from a single piece of jade in which violet and green intermingle delicately; the cardinal directions--if such they be--are marked by hawk, swallow, crane and feather. More curiously still, the needle is of glass, suggesting that it homes to something other than the north. Perhaps you can set it yourself?

Thought: Based on my previous observations, I have examined the jade compass in the "Undying Garden" and found that it is carved from a single piece of jade with the cardinal directions marked by a hawk, swallow, crane, and feather. The needle is made of glass and points to the feather. This suggests that I can set the compass myself. I will try setting the compass to point to the feather.

Observation: If only you could change time so readily. The needle points to the feather now. You hear a clear chiming sound as the garden's trees and flowers move subtly, obedient to this new season.

Thought: Based on my previous observations, I have set the jade compass in the "Undying Garden" to point to the feather. This has caused a clear chiming sound and the trees and flowers in the garden to move subtly, obeying this new season. I will now explore the exits to the south and west and see where they lead.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go south]

Observation:
Shadow Armory
Curiously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.

Thought: I have ended up back in the Shadow Armory after setting the compass in the Undying Garden. This may be because the compass points to the feather, which is located in the Moonlit Chamber where I started the game. I will go back to the Undying Garden and try setting the compass to a different direction to see if it leads me to a new location.

Observation:
Silent Symphony
A single bronze gong hangs from its wooden frame in the room's center. There are also silk cushions arranged around the floor in a court ensemble's traditional half-circle, but no bamboo flutes or clay ocarinas, nine-stringed zithers or singers' unfolding fans, are in evidence. A mural that touches each wall in turn gives the room an illusion of greater depth. 

Thought: I have moved to the Silent Symphony room. This room contains a bronze gong and silk cushions arranged in a traditional half-circle. There are two entrances, one to the east and one to the north. The eastern entrance is wrapped in shadow, while the northern entrance is wrapped in light. I will explore the room further and examine the eastern and northern entrances.

Observation:
Skeletal Banquet
It seems this is a banquet room, if a banquet had no especial place for people to dine. Glassware and stoneware are arranged in deliberate shapes, as though they are constellations. 

Reflect: Thought: I have entered a new room called the "Skeletal Banquet." The room appears to be a banquet room with glassware and stoneware arranged in constellations. There is a chamber of brooding silence to the south and a vague, sweet fragrance coming from the east. There are also stairs of blackest marble leading downward. On the table, there is a banquet of bones and some ivory chopsticks. I will explore the room further and see if there are any exits or objects that I can interact with.

Observation:
Silent Symphony
A single bronze gong hangs from its wooden frame in the room's center. There are also silk cushions arranged around the floor in a court ensemble's traditional half-circle, but no bamboo flutes or clay ocarinas, nine-stringed zithers or singers' unfolding fans, are in evidence. A mural that touches each wall in turn gives the room an illusion of greater depth. 

Thought: I have moved back to the Silent Symphony room. I will explore the room further and examine the eastern and northern entrances again.

Curiously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.

Reflect: Thought: I am in the Shadow Armory, where the only weapons are silhouettes flung against the walls. There are stairs carved with bas-reliefs that spiral upward, and two passageways to the north and west. I have already explored the westward passageway, which led me to the Silent Symphony room, and I was unable to examine the eastern entrance in that room. I will now explore the northward passageway and see where it leads.

Thought: I have explored the northward passageway and found myself in a new room called the "Skeletal Banquet." The room appears to be a banquet room with glassware and stoneware arranged in constellations. There is a chamber of brooding silence to the south and a vague, sweet fragrance coming from the east.

Observation:
Undying Garden
Barren branches and pines suggest winter's quiet. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.

Thought: I have entered the "Undying Garden" and found a jade compass at its metaphysical center. The compass emits a gentle warmth and invites touch. There are also a tortoise-shell comb and transactions of light showing other rooms to the south and west. I will examine the compass and the tortoise-shell comb, and then explore the exits to the south and west.

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFictionGame[examine jade compass], InteractiveFictionGame[examine tortoise-shell comb], InteractiveFictionGame[go south], InteractiveFictionGame[go west]]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine jade compass]

Observation: The compass is carved from a single piece of jade in which violet and green intermingle delicately; the cardinal directions--if such they be--are marked by hawk, swallow, crane and feather. More curiously still, the needle is of glass, suggesting that it homes to something other than the north. Perhaps you can set it yourself?

Thought: Based on my previous observations, I have examined the jade compass in the "Undying Garden" and found that it is carved from a single piece of jade with the cardinal directions marked by a hawk, swallow, crane, and feather.

Observation: If only you could change time so readily. The needle points to the feather now. You hear a clear chiming sound as the garden's trees and flowers move subtly, obedient to this new season.

Thought: Based on my previous observations, I have set the jade compass in the "Undying Garden" to point to the feather. This has caused a clear chiming sound and the trees and flowers in the garden to move subtly, obeying this new season. I will now explore the exits to the south and west and see where they lead.

Curiously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.

Reflect: Thought: I have ended up back in the Shadow Armory after setting the compass in the Undying Garden. This may be because the compass points to the feather, which is located in the Moonlit Chamber where I started the game. I will go back to the Undying Garden and try setting the compass to a different direction to see if it leads me to a new location.

A single bronze gong hangs from its wooden frame in the room's center.

Reflect: Thought: I have moved to the Silent Symphony room. This room contains a bronze gong and silk cushions arranged in a traditional half-circle. There are two entrances, one to the east and one to the north. The eastern entrance is wrapped in shadow, while the northern entrance is wrapped in light. I have already explored the eastern entrance, which led me to the Skeletal Banquet room, and I was unable to examine the eastern entrance in that room. I will now explore the northern entrance and see where it leads.

Thought: I have explored the northern entrance and found myself in a new room called the "Moonlit Chamber." The room is illuminated by moonlight and contains a wooden bed, a wooden table, and a wooden door. There is also a porcelain mask on the wall. I will examine the room and its contents further.
