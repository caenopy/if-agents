You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Follow the following format.

Observation: game observation based on previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

CandidateActions: A short list (at least 1 but not more than 5) of valid candidate actions to take based on the last observation and thought, for example '[InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south]]'. Each action is a few words using only simple verbs and nouns present in the environment from previous observations formatted as 'InteractiveFictionGame[<action>]

Action: choose one of the valid actions provided in CandidateActions, or, when done, Finish[answer]

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
You awaken in your tent, lying on the floor, with a hangover like you wouldn't believe. As you lever yourself up, you notice that there is complete silence instead of the usual morning complaints of the workers and Roboff's usual shouting. This can only mean one thing - Roboff must have finally run off on you. Panicked, you look around and see your amulet lying on the floor. At least Roboff had the sense to not trigger off your alarm. Knowing him, he also had the sense to take the emergency radio. How the megakrip are you going to get out of this one?

In Your Tent
You are in your tent in the encampment. The tent appears to have been completely cleaned out. It is very hot in here and getting hotter. The tent flap to the south is open.
On the ground is the ancient jeweled amulet that you "borrowed" from Mr. Meshugge.

Thought: It seems like I have woken up in my tent after a hangover, and Roboff has run off, leaving me in a difficult situation. I have an ancient jeweled amulet with me, and it is very hot in the tent. My objective seems to be to find a way out of this situation and escape from the encampment.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[look]

Observation:
In Your Tent
You are in your tent in the encampment. The tent appears to have been completely cleaned out. It is very hot in here and getting hotter. The tent flap to the south is open.

Reflect: After taking the amulet, I have looked around the tent to get a better understanding of my surroundings. I can see that the tent has been completely cleaned out and it is very hot in here. The tent flap to the south is open. I will consider going through the tent flap to explore the area outside the tent. I will also keep an eye out for any useful items or clues that might help me in my escape.

Thought: I have left the tent and entered the encampment. It is very hot here and the sun is beating down on the encampment. To the north is my tent, to the east is the dining hall, to the west is the medical tent, and to the south is a large gate with a guard standing in front of it. My objective is still to find a way out of the encampment. I will consider going to the dining hall or the medical tent to see if I can find any useful items or clues. I will also consider talking to the guard to see if I can convince him to let me through the gate.
