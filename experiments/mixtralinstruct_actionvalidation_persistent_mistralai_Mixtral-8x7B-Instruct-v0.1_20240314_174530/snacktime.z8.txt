<RRROWWGRROWL> Your stomach growls.

Sitting Room
This is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food. That is a good room.

Even though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of "no"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.

Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.
> Go west
Food Room
Food room, glorious food room!

Your bowl for food and water is here, but that's only the beginning. There's also a lot of secret places where your pet keeps food and things that go with food and things that make food better. There's a thing that gets hot and a box that stays cold, and that is your favorite because you know there is always food inside there. A cloth hangs down from the door of the cold box.

> examine hot thing
It's not always hot, but you've learned to stay away from it just in case it is.
> examine cold box
The cold box hums softly. It must be happy because it has a lot of food inside it. That always makes you happy.

Right now the door is closed, so you can't see the food inside. But you know it's there. A cloth hangs down from the door right at your nose level.
> examine cloth hanging from cold box
I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the cloth.
> take cloth hanging from cold box
You can't see any such thing.
> examine cloth hanging from cold box
I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the cloth.
> touch cloth hanging from cold box
I only understood you as far as wanting to touch the cloth.
> look at cloth hanging from cold box
I only understood you as far as wanting to look at the cloth.
> open cold box
This is a good trick!

You pull on the cloth with your teeth and back up as the door opens. Inside you can see various leftovers, some jars, some sandwich fixings and one shiny can.
> take shiny can
You snatch up the shiny can with your mouth and hold on tight.
> take sandwich fixings
(As you open your mouth, you drop the shiny can.)

All the food in the cold box is up too high for you or closed away. Looks like you will need your pet to help you get a snack.
> inventory
Right now you aren't carrying anything. (It's not like you need a lot of stuff, anyway.)
> go north
From here, you can only go east to the sitting room.
> go east
Before you leave the food room, you push the cold box door with your nose to close it. (It's important to conserve energy.)

Sitting Room
Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.
> wake up pet
That's a good idea. Maybe if you make some noise or disturb him somehow he would wake up.
> shake pet
You tuck your head up under your pet and push back and forth to shake him.

Your pet twitches a little and stirs, then is still again. It's a start at waking him up.
> shake pet
You tuck your head up under your pet and push back and forth to shake him.

Hmm, your pet seems to have turned that into part of his dream or something, because he sure didn't move this time when you shook him.
> examine x
You can't see any such thing.

> examine tall thing
It almost could touch the ceiling if it would stand on its hind legs which it doesn't seem to be able to do. Maybe if it weren't weighed down with all that stuff it holds.
> examine stuff on tall thing
I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the stuff.
> take something from stuff on tall thing
You can't see any such thing.

Sleeping Room
Most of the time when you are in here it is dark and quiet because that is the best way to sleep and this is the room made for sleeping. There is a high bed here that is not your bed although it is where you sleep usually to keep your pet company. The sitting room is south of here and the room with the water is to the west.

Your low bed is here, looking all soft and cushy.

Dino is here!
