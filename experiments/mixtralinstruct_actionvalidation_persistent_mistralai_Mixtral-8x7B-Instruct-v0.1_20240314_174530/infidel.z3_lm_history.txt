You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Follow the following format.

Observation: game observation based on previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

CandidateActions: A short list (at least 1 but not more than 5) of valid candidate actions to take based on the last observation and thought, for example '[InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south]]'. Each action is a few words using only simple verbs and nouns present in the environment from previous observations formatted as 'InteractiveFictionGame[<action>]

Action: choose one of the valid actions provided in CandidateActions, or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
The Professor's map was just an ancient map -- as worthless as an ice cube in the Arctic without an instrument fine enough to accurately measure longitude and latitude. You knew that the site was nearby. You dug, and you ordered the workers to dig, even without the box. As you listen to the plane and rub your aching eyes, you pray they left you supplies enough to find the pyramid and to survive, and that the plane's carrying the long-overdue box.

Your Tent
(You are in the army cot.)
You are in your tent. Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little.
At the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am in a tent with a large trunk at the foot of the bed. The trunk is locked with a padlock. I need to find a way to open the trunk to access its contents. I will try to look around the tent for any clues or items that might help me open the trunk.

Observation:
Your Tent
(You are in the army cot.)
You are in your tent. Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little.
At the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent.

Thought: Based on the new observation, I don't see any new items or clues in the tent. I will now try to interact with the trunk and see if I can open it.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine trunk]

Observation:
It's an old steamer trunk, very heavy and too clumsy for one person to carry.

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent.

Thought: Based on the new observation, I see that the trunk is an old steamer trunk. It is too heavy for one person to carry, and I still need to find a way to open it. I will try to look around the tent again for any clues or items that might help me open the trunk.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[look around the tent]

Observation:
Your Tent
(You are in the army cot.)
You are in your tent. Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little.
At the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent.

Reflect: After reflecting on my progress and strategy, I realize that I have been focusing too much on looking around the tent and examining the trunk. I have not tried interacting with the trunk in any other way except looking at it. I will try to use or take something from the trunk to see if that helps me open it.

Thought: Based on my reflection, I will try to interact with the trunk by using or taking something from it. I will try to use the `InteractiveFictionGame[take trunk]` action to see if I can pick it up or move it, and possibly find a way to open it.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[take trunk]

Observation:
With this kind of wisdom, be glad you're not in a Sphinx.

It sounds as if the plane is circling.

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that taking the trunk resulted in some kind of response, but it's not clear what it means. The plane is still circling, and I am still in the tent with the trunk. I will try to examine the trunk again to see if there are any new details.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine trunk]

Observation:
It's an old steamer trunk, very heavy and too clumsy for one person to carry.

It sounds as if the plane is circling.

Thought: Based on the new observation, examining the trunk again did not provide any new information. The trunk is still an old steamer trunk, and it is still too heavy to carry. The plane is still circling, and I am still in the tent with the trunk. I will try to open the trunk to see if there are any items inside that I can use.

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFictionGame[open old steamer trunk]]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[open trunk]

Observation:
A padlock holds it shut.

It sounds as if the plane is flying off.

Thought: Based on the new observation, I see that the trunk is locked with a padlock. I need to find a way to open the padlock. I will try to look around the tent again for any clues or items that might help me open the padlock.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine padlock]

Observation:
It's made of hardened steel and is very sturdy. It's also very locked.

You can barely hear the plane.

Thought: Based on the new observation, the padlock is made of hardened steel and is very sturdy. It is also very locked, which suggests that it will be difficult to pick or open without the proper tools. I will try to look around the tent again for any clues or items that might help me open the padlock.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine x], where x is an object in the tent that could help open the padlock.

Observation: I don't know the word "x".

Reflect: After reflecting on my progress and strategy, I realize that I have been trying to open the padlock without any tools or clues.

I will examine the trunk again to see if there are any objects inside that I can use to open the padlock.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine tent flaps more carefully]

Observation: I don't know the word "more".

Reflect:[[ After reflecting on my progress and strategy, I realize that I have been focusing too much on the tent flaps. I need to expand my search and look for other objects in the tent that might help me open the padlock or access the contents of the trunk. I will examine the room more thoroughly and look for any objects that could be useful.

Thought: Based on my reflection, I will examine the room more thoroughly and look for any objects that could be useful. I will use the `InteractiveFictionGame[examine x]` action to examine each object in the room and see if it can help me open the padlock or access the contents of the trunk.

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFictionGame[examine x]]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine x], where x is an object in the room that has not been examined yet.

Observation: I don't know the word "x".

Thought: I need to specify which object to examine. I will look around the room and choose an object that has not been examined yet.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine trunk]

Observation: It's an old steamer trunk, very heavy and too clumsy for one person to carry.

Thought: Based on the new observation, examining the trunk again did not provide any new information. The trunk is still an old steamer trunk, and it is still too heavy to carry. I will try to interact with the trunk in a different way to see if that helps me open it.
