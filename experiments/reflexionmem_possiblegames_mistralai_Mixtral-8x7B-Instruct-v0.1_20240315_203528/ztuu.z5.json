A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages.\"\n\n\"And Fretsham the Fortunate?\" you ask hopefully.\n\n\"A fatality!\" the Inquisitor booms. \"Here,\" he says with evaporating patience, \"take these and be of good cheer.\" He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever.\n\n\"But what of Kolchack the --\"\n\n\"Enough!

This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.",
