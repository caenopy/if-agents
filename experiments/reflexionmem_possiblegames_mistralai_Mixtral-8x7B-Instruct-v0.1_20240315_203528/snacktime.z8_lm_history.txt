Sitting Room
This is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food. That is a good room.

Even though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of "no"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.

Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.

Memory: You are in the sitting room with your pet and your stomach is growling, reminding you that there is a room to the west with food.

Food Room
Food room, glorious food room!

Your bowl for food and water is here, but that's only the beginning. There's also a lot of secret places where your pet keeps food and things that go with food and things that make food better.

Reflect: Based on my memory, I know that the Food Room contains various objects like a bowl, a hot thing, a cold box with food inside, leftovers, jars, sandwich fixings, and a shiny can.

Most of the time when you are in here it is dark and quiet because that is the best way to sleep and this is the room made for sleeping.
