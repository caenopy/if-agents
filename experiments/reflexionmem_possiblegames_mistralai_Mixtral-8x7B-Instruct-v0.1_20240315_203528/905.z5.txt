The phone rings.

Oh, no - how long have you been asleep? Sure, it was a tough night, but... This is bad. This is very bad.

Bedroom (in bed)
This bedroom is extremely spare, with dirty laundry scattered haphazardly all over the floor. Cleaner clothing can be found in the dresser. A bathroom lies to the south, while a door to the east leads to the living room.

On the end table are a telephone, a wallet and some keys.

The phone rings.
> Answer the phone
You pick up the phone. "Hadley!" a shrill voice cries. "Hadley, haven't you even left yet?? You knew that our presentation was at nine o'clock sharp! First the thing with the printers, now this - there won't even be enough left of you for Bowman to fire once he's done with you. Now get the hell down here!!"

Living room
The furniture isn't as carefully arranged as one might like, and it's a bit lacking in the luxuries that might make this a more pleasant place to spend an evening - no stereo, no TV, no DVD, none of that - but this living room is still nicer than most of those in this neighborhood. A kitchenette lies to the east, the bedroom to the west and the front door to the south.

The front door is closed.

You open the front door.
> Go through the front door
You need to clear out quickly, true, but you look like an absolute wreck - going out in this condition and drawing the inevitable bewildered stares would just be making a bad situation worse.
