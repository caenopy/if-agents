You've been slacking off all semester long, and it's catching up to you. That final paper is due for your Computer Science class (\"The History of IF Games\"), and you desperately need to check out a comprehensive book on Graham Nelson, one of the foremost authors of the obscure genre of interactive-fiction. You know there is exactly one such book, but you have no idea where it might be! \n\nThe first time player should probably type \"help\".\n\nALL QUIET ON THE LIBRARY FRONT\nAn Interactive Vignette\nRelease 2 / Serial number 951204 / Inform v1502 Library 5/12\nStandard interpreter 1.0\n\nLobby\nThis is the entrance to the library. The circulation desk dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of desks and tables. A pair of security gates stands before the front doors to prevent people from stealing books. A card catalog lurks in a dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh flourescent light. Glass doors to the west lead to the book stacks; an archway to the northwest is labelled \"Duplicating Services\"; a door to the north bears a sign marked \"Private\" in large friendly letters; and the exit is to the east\n\nYou can see a circulation desk attendant here.",
