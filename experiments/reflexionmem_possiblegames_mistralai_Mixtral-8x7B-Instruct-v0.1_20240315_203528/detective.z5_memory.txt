You are in the Chief's office. The Chief told you that the Mayor was murdered yesterday night at 12:03 am and wants you to solve it before there is any bad publicity or the FBI has to come in. You replied "Yessir!" to the Chief. The Chief handed you a sheet of paper. There is a piece of white paper in the room. Your score has gone up by ten points.
