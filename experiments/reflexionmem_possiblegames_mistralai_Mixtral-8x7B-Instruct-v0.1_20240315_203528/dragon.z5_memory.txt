The council discussed the dragon, its impact on the land, and the Sword of Erondil. The sword is the only weapon that can harm the dragon and was last seen in the Castle of Abercorn. The dragon is held in place by an old enchantment, and breaking the spell may cause it to leave. The player has been chosen to deal with the dragon and left near a mountain path in the North-East.
