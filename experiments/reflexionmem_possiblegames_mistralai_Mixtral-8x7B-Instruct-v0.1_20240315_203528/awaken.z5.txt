You remember darkness. And the cold. Cold and darkness. And silence. Those memories are all that you have. That, and a feeling that something you never knew you possessed has been lost.

Suddenly, oblivion is split by a blinding light and a crash of sound. You awaken to the roar of a storm and a deluge of rain and mud.

In the Mud
Rain and muddy water are pouring down on you, making it difficult to see or even breathe. Sodden earth and mud surrounds you on all sides except overhead, where flashes of lightning illuminate a storm tossed sky.
