Sitting Room
This is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food. That is a good room.

Even though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of "no"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.

Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.
> go west
Food Room
Food room, glorious food room!

Your bowl for food and water is here, but that's only the beginning. There's also a lot of secret places where your pet keeps food and things that go with food and things that make food better. There's a thing that gets hot and a box that stays cold, and that is your favorite because you know there is always food inside there. A cloth hangs down from the door of the cold box.
> open cold box
This is a good trick!

You pull on the cloth with your teeth and back up as the door opens. Inside you can see various leftovers, some jars, some sandwich fixings and one shiny can.
> look around
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> examine cold box
The cold box hums softly. It must be happy because it has a lot of food inside it. That always makes you happy.

Right now it's open and blasting you with cold air. Inside you can see various leftovers, some jars, some sandwich fixings and one shiny can.
> examine shiny can
It's shiny and filled with some liquid that your pet really likes.
> examine leftovers
Sometimes your pet makes something and saves some of it in the cold box to see how long it takes to grow fuzzy stuff on it. It's an interesting experiment, but not much good to you when you are hungry.
> examine shiny can
It's shiny and filled with some liquid that your pet really likes.
> look around
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> go east
Before you leave the food room, you push the cold box door with your nose to close it. (It's important to conserve energy.)

> go north
Sleeping Room
Most of the time when you are in here it is dark and quiet because that is the best way to sleep and this is the room made for sleeping. There is a high bed here that is not your bed although it is where you sleep usually to keep your pet company. The sitting room is south of here and the room with the water is to the west.

Your low bed is here, looking all soft and cushy.

Dino is here!
> examine Dino
It's your chewy dinosaur friend.
> talk to Dino
You talk to your dino a lot. Dino knows all your secrets.
> ask Dino about objectives
You only do that to stuff that's alive.
> ask Dino what to do
You only do that to stuff that's alive.
> ask Dino if there is anything I need to do
You only do that to stuff that's alive.
> look around
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> look under high bed
You stick your head under the bed for a closer look and discover... a sock! Your pet has probably been looking for this, since socks usually stick together. You wonder why this one ran away.
> look around
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> go south
Sitting Room
Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.

That's a good idea. Maybe if you make some noise or disturb him somehow he would wake up.
