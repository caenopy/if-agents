Follow the following format.

History: The previous 10 rounds of gameplay.
Observation: The game's text response to the last action. Your action should be based on this.
Action: A simple action, no more than 4 words long, using only simple verbs and nouns present in the environment from previous observations. Some common actions are 'look', 'take', 'drop', 'turn on', 'push', 'pull', 'go north', etc.

History: Observation: That's not a verb I recognise. Action: "take the bent spoon" Observation: Taken. The rustling sounds stop. Action: "examine the spoon" Observation: The spoon is slightly bent, as if it has been stepped on. Suddenly, from the corner of your eye, you glimpse a streak of moth-eaten fur hurtling toward you from the forest! Your heart races, yet you stand paralyzed with fear; your mind screams at your unresponsive body to flee. Run! Run for your life! Too late. Alas, too late. "Boo!" snarls a big, bad wolf, who is huffing and puffing from all the exertion. His eyes narrow into slits as he studies you closely. "Hey, wait just a minute! You ain't Little Red Riding Hood." "Listen up," warns the wolf. "In case you forgot, I get blamed for everything around here. So watch it. I ain't takin' no rap for you." Action: "talk to the wolf" Observation: To talk to the wolf, try this: "wolf, do something" "Listen up," warns the wolf. "In case you forgot, I get blamed for everything around here. So watch it. I ain't takin' no rap for you." Action: "ask the wolf for help" Observation: "I don't know nothin' about nothin'," the wolf insists. Action: "offer the wolf food" Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: "give the wolf a bone" Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: "show the wolf kindness" Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: "apologize to the wolf" Observation: "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure thing. Whatever you say, kiddo." "Listen up," warns the wolf. "In case you forgot, I get blamed for everything around here. So watch it. I ain't takin' no rap for you." Action: "ask the wolf for directions" Observation: The wolf snarls at you and chews on a toothpick. "Don't mind me; I was just leaving," mentions the wolf over his shoulder as he skulks out of sight. Action: "search for a map"
Observation: Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice. Anyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new "Surfers Monthly" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening. Shyeah, right. That's what YOU think.

Updated and revised 1998 Release 1 / Serial number 990110 / Inform v6.10 Library 6/5 Standard interpreter 1.0 Behind the Counter You are behind the counter at "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor", where you are currently working. Not much of a job, but it keeps you from going broke during the nine months of the year when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing instructor. The rest of the parlor is southwest. There is something pressing that you think you have to do, but you can't think what it might be.
Action:[[ "leave the pizza parlor"]]

History: Observation: Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice. Anyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new "Surfers Monthly" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening. Shyeah, right. That's what YOU think.
