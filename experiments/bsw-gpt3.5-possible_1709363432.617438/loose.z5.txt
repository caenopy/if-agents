What was that?

You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.

"No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind."

After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.

Rickety Fence
The ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other. Although it hasn't fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and if that egg isn't careful...

The footpath running along the fence veers sharply north.

The egg hums a little tune your mother used to sing at bedtime.

> "examine the egg"
Although somewhat short and rotund, the egg takes obvious pride in his appearance, wearing neatly pressed dark slacks and a white, button-down shirt with the initials H.D. embroidered on the collar. His necktie is conservative, his shoes polished, his handkerchief clean and folded.

The egg wobbles ever so slightly on the narrow ledge of the fence.

"Leaving so soon?" sighs the egg. "Well, be careful. Dangerous creatures lurk in the shadows."

Forest
The sun has disappeared. Only a narrow north-south passage winds through the forest here; trees and gnarled undergrowth barricade all other exits. Chill air seeps up from the ground and coils around your body, reaching down your neck with insistent, clammy fingers.
> "continue north"
That's not a verb I recognise.
> "walk north"

Deep Forest
Wet branches slap your face, their icy needles stinging. Dense underbrush creeps in from all sides. With each step, mud oozes into your shoes. Insects drop from above and crawl through your hair; knuckles scrape against rough bark. The path hooks from south to southwest here, slithering between the trees like a snake. Faint rustling sounds catch your ear, but when you turn to look, all is still and quiet.

At your feet, a green and yellow basket lies on its side. Whoever dropped it must have been in a hurry, because the contents have spilled out and are strewn everywhere.

An iron pot has come to rest at the edge of the footpath, near a tree.

You can also see a cracked porcelain dish and a bent spoon here.
> "pick up the iron pot"
Taken.

The whispery rustling grows louder.
> "investigate the rustling noise"
That's not a verb I recognise.
> "follow the rustling sound"
You can't see any such thing.
> "listen for rustling noise"
You can't see any such thing.
> "look for source of rustling"
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> "search for rustling source"
You can't see any such thing.
> "continue north"
That's not a verb I recognise.
> "move north"
You are unable to.

You glance around nervously. The rustling seems very close now.
> "hide behind a tree"
That's not a verb I recognise.
> "take the bent spoon"
Taken.

The rustling sounds stop.
> "examine the spoon"
The spoon is slightly bent, as if it has been stepped on.

Suddenly, from the corner of your eye, you glimpse a streak of moth-eaten fur hurtling toward you from the forest! Your heart races, yet you stand paralyzed with fear; your mind screams at your unresponsive body to flee. Run! Run for your life!

Too late. Alas, too late.

"Boo!" snarls a big, bad wolf, who is huffing and puffing from all the exertion. His eyes narrow into slits as he studies you closely. "Hey, wait just a minute! You ain't Little Red Riding Hood."

"Listen up," warns the wolf. "In case you forgot, I get blamed for everything around here. So watch it. I ain't takin' no rap for you."
> "talk to the wolf"
To talk to the wolf, try this: "wolf, do something"

"Listen up," warns the wolf. "In case you forgot, I get blamed for everything around here. So watch it. I ain't takin' no rap for you."
> "ask the wolf for help"
"I don't know nothin' about nothin'," the wolf insists.
> "offer the wolf food"
You can't see any such thing.
> "give the wolf a bone"
You can't see any such thing.
> "show the wolf kindness"
You can't see any such thing.
> "apologize to the wolf"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure thing. Whatever you say, kiddo."

"Listen up," warns the wolf. "In case you forgot, I get blamed for everything around here. So watch it. I ain't takin' no rap for you."
> "ask the wolf for directions"
The wolf snarls at you and chews on a toothpick.

"Don't mind me; I was just leaving," mentions the wolf over his shoulder as he skulks out of sight.
> "search for a map"
You can't see any such thing.
