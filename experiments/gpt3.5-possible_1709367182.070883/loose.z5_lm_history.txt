Observation: What was that? You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north. "No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind." After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.

History: Observation: That's not a verb I recognise. Action: "move north" Observation: You are unable to. You glance around nervously. The rustling seems very close now. Action: "hide behind a tree" Observation: That's not a verb I recognise. Action: "take the bent spoon" Observation: Taken. The rustling sounds stop. Action: "examine the spoon" Observation: The spoon is slightly bent, as if it has been stepped on. Suddenly, from the corner of your eye, you glimpse a streak of moth-eaten fur hurtling toward you from the forest! Your heart races, yet you stand paralyzed with fear; your mind screams at your unresponsive body to flee. Run! Run for your life! Too late. Alas, too late. "Boo!" snarls a big, bad wolf, who is huffing and puffing from all the exertion. His eyes narrow into slits as he studies you closely. "Hey, wait just a minute! You ain't Little Red Riding Hood." "Listen up," warns the wolf. "In case you forgot, I get blamed for everything around here. So watch it. I ain't takin' no rap for you." Action: "talk to the wolf" Observation: To talk to the wolf, try this: "wolf, do something" "Listen up," warns the wolf. "In case you forgot, I get blamed for everything around here. So watch it. I ain't takin' no rap for you." Action: "ask the wolf for help" Observation: "I don't know nothin' about nothin'," the wolf insists. Action: "offer the wolf food" Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: "give the wolf a bone" Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: "show the wolf kindness" Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: "apologize to the wolf"
Observation: "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure thing. Whatever you say, kiddo." "Listen up," warns the wolf. "In case you forgot, I get blamed for everything around here. So watch it. I ain't takin' no rap for you."
