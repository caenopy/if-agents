You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: a response provided by the game based on the previous action

Reflect: self-reflection on your progress and the effectiveness of recent moves

Memory: a memory fetched from previous experience and based the current situation
            
Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: a simple action of a few words using only simple verbs and nouns present in the environment from previous observations. Some common actions are 'look', 'take', 'drop', 'turn on', 'push', 'pull', 'go north', etc."

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake.

Sitting Room
This is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food. That is a good room.

Even though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of "no"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.

Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.

Memory: You are in the sitting room with your pet and your stomach is growling, reminding you that there is a room to the west with food.

Thought: Based on my memory, I know that there is a room to the west with food. I should go there and get something to eat. This will not only satisfy my hunger but also give me the energy I need to explore the game further.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go west]

Observation:
Food Room
Food room, glorious food room!

Your bowl for food and water is here, but that's only the beginning. There's also a lot of secret places where your pet keeps food and things that go with food and things that make food better. There's a thing that gets hot and a box that stays cold, and that is your favorite because you know there is always food inside there. A cloth hangs down from the door of the cold box.

Memory: The Food Room contains a bowl for food and water and a cold box with food inside and a cloth hanging down from its door.

Thought: Based on my memory, the Food Room contains a cold box with food inside. I should open the cold box and take some food to eat. This will satisfy my hunger and give me the energy I need to explore the game further.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[take shiny can]

Observation: You snatch up the shiny can with your mouth and hold on tight.

However, it seems that I can't use the tall thing to block any distractions or obstacles. I need to find another way to open the can.

I could also try to use the tall thing to create a shield or a barrier, which might protect me from any potential dangers or hazards that might be associated with opening the can. If these approaches don't work, I will consider looking for other objects or tools in the room that might help me open the can.
