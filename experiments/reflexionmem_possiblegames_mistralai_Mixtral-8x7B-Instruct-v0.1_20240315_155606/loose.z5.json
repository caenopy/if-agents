Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who confesses, \"I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind.\"\n\nAfter a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, \"It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo.\" The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.\n\n[Press a key to begin.]\n\n\n\n\n\nMOTHER LOOSE\nAn Interactive Nursery Rhyme\nCopyright (c) 1998 by Irene Callaci.\nRelease 2 / Serial number 981128 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/7\n\nRickety Fence\nThe ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other.
