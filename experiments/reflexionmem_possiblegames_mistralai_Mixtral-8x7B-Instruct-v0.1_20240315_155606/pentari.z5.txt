A beautiful day in Bostwin! You are awakened by a ray of sunlight peeking through a window shade and rise refreshed after a restful night's sleep.  You've given your Company a weekend pass to get some R&R after your last grueling mission.  Wasting precious little time your entire company took off for the city proper to pack in as much drinking, carousing, brawling, wenching and other relaxing pursuits as possible in 48 hours.  In the fields of battle your men are an elite unit of trained professionals.  Off-duty they're pretty much like every other bunch of soldiers you've ever served with. 

A weekend off and what to do? After the challenges of the past year when you were first promoted and assumed command of Charlie Company you've nearly forgotton what free time is and what you're supposed to do with it.

Your Quarters
Rank certainly does have its privileges.  When you were a lowly lieutenant you had to share cramped quarters with a fellow lieutenant at your previous assignment.  Commanding a company of your own affords you the luxury of private, spacious quarters just outside the barracks themselves. As a further abuse of your power your chest and bunk are not standard issue items from the Pentari millitary supply center.
