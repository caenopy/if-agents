No, not a prison, though stone stands around you, as expressionless as a mirror awaiting face and form; and in the silence you hear no plaint of flute or roar of gong, but instead the crash of porcelain shattering.

Moonlit Chamber
Moonlight diffuses through the walls, tracing out unreadable sigils in calligraphies of light and dark. Stairs adorned with bas-relief motifs spiral downward.

You can see a porcelain mask here.
> look at the porcelain mask
The half-mask is the pale, almost bluish color of the finest celadon, cracked with uncanny precision down its axis of symmetry. The face in its blank, sculpted features has no more personality than new-forged steel. Half a mask, though--that must mean the left half is--

Shadow Armory
Shadows gather around you. For a moment, dregs of light defined by the negative space take on the shapes of maple leaf, kite, comb, and other shapes that flicker across the walls too rapidly for you to interpret.

Curiously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.

Northward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen.
> look around
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> Look at the shadows
Weapons line the walls, writ in shadow--yet you know their heft and balance, the patterns of movement that make one deadly in attack and another impenetrable in defense. If only you knew, as well, the histories of blood, patronage and betrayal--or loyalty--that they represent.

One of the weapons is more substantial than you realized at first, a bronze-hilted dagger with a tassel hanging from the pommel.
> look at the bronze-hilted dagger
Such daggers rarely leave the hands of the justiciars who wield them as their symbol of office. A white tassel hangs from the pommel of the hilt.
> take the justiciar's dagger
You can't see any such thing.
> take the bronze-hilted dagger with the white tassel
(first taking the white tassel)
It is inseparable from the dagger.

Each step is carved upon the side in bas-relief, though the design is abstract.

The shapes of light you saw as you entered fade irrevocably.

You are not a thing of light and shadow, to pass through things substantial with sightless ease.

Silent Symphony
A single bronze gong hangs from its wooden frame in the room's center. There are also silk cushions arranged around the floor in a court ensemble's traditional half-circle, but no bamboo flutes or clay ocarinas, nine-stringed zithers or singers' unfolding fans, are in evidence. A mural that touches each wall in turn gives the room an illusion of greater depth. 

Two entrances, one east, one north; the former is wrapped in shadow, the latter in light.
> look at the gong
The gong stands taller than a man, and its rim is etched with faint characters. The surface has no patina; there is no mallet with which to strike it and signal the absent musicians to begin.
> look at the mural
The mural shows court ladies whispering to each other in a garden; men kneel to float folded-paper poems down the brook for them to read.
