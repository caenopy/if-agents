Reasoning: The observation indicates that the player is on a branch in the forest. This is a new location, so we need to add it to the memory stream. The branch has one obvious exit, down, which we should include in the location's exit list. The branch is also located in the forest, so we can add the oak tree to the visible objects list. The confidence level for this new memory is set to 90%.

Additionally, the observation mentions a lake, which is not currently present in the memory stream. We should add the lake as a new location, with the visible objects and exits that were mentioned in the observation. The confidence level for
{ "location": "meadow", "exits": ["North", "South", "East", "West"], "visible\_objects": ["sleeping Dragon", "sign", "grass"] }

Confidence: 90%
{ "location": "branch", "exits": ["Down"], "visible\_objects": ["oak tree"] }
