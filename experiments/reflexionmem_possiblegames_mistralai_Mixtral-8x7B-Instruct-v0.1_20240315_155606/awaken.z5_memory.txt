The player character wakes up in a muddy and rainy environment, with rain and muddy water pouring down on them. They are surrounded by sodden earth and mud on all sides, except for overhead where flashes of lightning illuminate the storm tossed sky.
The storm is characterized by howling wind, frequent lightning, and a barrage of thunder that joins with the wind in a mad concaphony.
The sides of the hole are made of dark, rich earth, which is now soaked through by the torrential downpour. More and more mud is being washed away and into the hole as the player character watches.
