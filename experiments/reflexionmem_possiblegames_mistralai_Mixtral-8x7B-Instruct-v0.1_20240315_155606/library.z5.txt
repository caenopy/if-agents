You are a student at Anycollege, in Anytown, and it's the end of the semester!  You've been slacking off all semester long, and it's catching up to you. That final paper is due for your Computer Science class ("The History of IF Games"), and you desperately need to check out a comprehensive book on Graham Nelson, one of the foremost authors of the obscure genre of interactive-fiction. You know there is exactly one such book, but you have no idea where it might be! 

The first time player should probably type "help".

Lobby
This is the entrance to the library. The circulation desk dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of desks and tables. A pair of security gates stands before the front doors to prevent people from stealing books. A card catalog lurks in a dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh flourescent light. Glass doors to the west lead to the book stacks; an archway to the northwest is labelled "Duplicating Services"; a door to the north bears a sign marked "Private" in large friendly letters; and the exit is to the east

You can see a circulation desk attendant here.

> go west
You push the glass doors open. Their hydraulics hiss faintly.

Ground Floor Stacks
This cavernous room is lit with flickering flourescent lighting which makes the ceiling look even lower than it really is. It is filled with half-empty shelves, upon which rest the dusty boxes of many early games. To one side sits a massive, ancient desk, its surface cluttered with paperwork. A sign on the wall indicates that this is the reference desk, which would make the prim young woman sitting behind it the reference librarian. A doorway to the north is labelled "Stairs", and glass doors lead east to the lobby.

You can see a reference librarian here.
> ask reference librarian about the Graham Nelson book
"Ah, that valuable book. We keep it locked away, in the Rare Books Room."

> examine door
The sign on the northern door says "Private" in large friendly letters, the same kind of lettering which is usually seen on signs saying "Attack-Trained Rottweilers Patrolling Premises After Business Hours".

You can't see any such thing.

> ask reference librarian about the Rare Books Room
"The Rare Books Room is on the second floor. Stairs are north of here. You will need the key, though."
> go north
Ground Floor Stairwell
Grungy stairs lead upwards, to the second level. A damaged picture hangs on the wall. The door to the ground floor shelving area is to the south.
> examine damaged picture
This defaced painting may once have been a company logo of some sort, but it has been damaged severely by some sort of sharp instrument. All that remains is a letter A to the left, some sort of check mark in the middle, and the letter N at the far right.

> examine card catalog
Almost no light penetrates this corner of the room. The card catalog is in the usual shape, a box on legs with a myriad of small drawers, each labelled in crabbed writing. However, the entire card catalog is festooned with cobwebs. The dust on top is so thick that it looks like grubby grey felt.

You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

I only understood you as far as wanting to open the card catalog drawer.
