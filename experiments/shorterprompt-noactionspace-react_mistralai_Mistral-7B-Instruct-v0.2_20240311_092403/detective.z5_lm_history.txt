You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Input: An instruction to play the game.

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start the interactive fiction game by taking the initial action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'. If the game ends or I die, I will use my experience to make a better choice in the next iteration.

<< Chief's office >>
You are standing in the Chief's office. He is telling you "The Mayor was murdered yeaterday night at 12:03 am. I want you to solve it before we get any bad publicity or the FBI has to come in. "Yessir!" You reply. He hands you a sheet of paper. Once you have read it, go north or west.

You can see a piece of white paper here.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

Thought 2: Based on the observation, I will read the paper given by the Chief to gather more information about the case. Then, I will explore the surroundings by going north or west to look for clues or interview suspects.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Read the paper]

Observation 2:
CONFIDENTIAL:
Detective was created by Matt Barringer.
He has worked hard on this so you better enjoy it.
I did have fun making it though. But I'd REALLY appreciate it if you were kind enough to send a postcard or... dare I even say it?... money... to:

Just tell me if you like it or not.
If you want to talk to me over a BBS call the Ghostbuster Central BBS at (510)208-5657.
There is an Exile Games file area. Have fun. I WILL give hints out over the BBS to any of my games.

Thought 3: Based on the observation, it seems that the author of the game has provided some contact information and a request for feedback. However, there is no immediate relevance to the case at hand. I will focus on exploring the surroundings by going north or west to look for clues or interview suspects.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation 3:
<< Outside >>
You are outside in the cold. To the east is a dead end. To the west is the rest of the street. Papers are blowing around. It's amazingly cold for this time of year.

Thought 4: Based on the observation, I will explore the rest of the street to the west to look for any clues or suspects related to the murder case.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation 4:
<< Outside >>
You are still on the streets. To the north is a restraunt where the mayor ate often. To the east is the Mayor's home.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

Thought 5: Based on the observation, I will head to the restaurant where the mayor often ate to look for any clues or suspects related to the murder case.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation 5:
<< Restraunt >>
You are about to enter the restraunt when two guys jump you. They take your wallet and beat you a bit. Then you flash your badge and that riles them. Your body was discovered in a river 10 miles away.


    *** You have died ***


In that game you scored 20 out of a possible 360, in 4 turns.

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, give the FULL score for that game or QUIT?

Thought 6: Based on the observation, I have died in the game. I will use this experience to make a better choice in the next iteration. I will restart the game and try a different approach to explore the surroundings and gather information about the case.
