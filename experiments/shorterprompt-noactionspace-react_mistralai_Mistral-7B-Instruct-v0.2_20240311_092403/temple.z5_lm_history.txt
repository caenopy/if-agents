You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Input: An instruction to play the game.

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start the interactive fiction game by taking the initial action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'. If the game ends or I die, I will use my experience to make a better choice in the next iteration.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.

Void
You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner.

Thought 2: I will explore my current environment by checking the surroundings and looking for any objects or clues that may help me progress in the game.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine surroundings]

Observation 2: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 3: I will try to move around and explore my current location further to find any objects or clues that may help me progress in the game.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Move north]

Observation 3:
You are unable to.

A cascade of red colour explodes below you.

Thought 4: I will try to find an alternative way to move or look for any objects or clues that may help me progress in the game.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine inventory]

Observation 4: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 5: I will try to remember any previous actions or clues that may have given me an item or ability to progress. If I can't recall anything, I will explore my current location further or try to interact with the objects around me.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine objects]

Observation 5:
They are sometimes stationary, sometimes moving around. Their movement is not linear and they seem to suddenly dissolve from one place, only to appear from nothing in a new place, apparently at random. Although they sometimes are close to you they always appear hazy.

Suddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long.

Thought 6: I will try to move away from the shape to avoid being overwhelmed by fear. If I cannot move, I will try to find an object or clue that may help me progress or interact with the shape in some way.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[Move away from the shape]

Observation 6: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 7: I will try to interact with the shape to understand its nature or find a way to progress.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the shape]

Observation 7:
In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.

The shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.

Roof
The city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star-filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down.

Thought 8: I have entered a new location, a roof of an ancient tower. I will explore this new environment by checking the surroundings and looking for any objects or clues that may help me progress in the game.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine surroundings]

Thought 10: I will try to examine the tower and its structure for any clues or hidden objects that may help me progress in the game.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine tower]

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine winding staircase]

Observation 13: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 14: I will try to use a different verb recognized by the game to interact with the tower or explore my current location further.

Action 14: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the railing]

Observation 14: The most spectacular thing about the railing is the small statues decorating it. The artist must have used his most morbid fantasies for inspiration when carving these monsters, yet they are realistic to minute detail.

Thought 15: I will try to interact with the statues on the railing to see if they have any hidden functions or clues that may help me progress in the game.

Action 15: InteractiveFictionGame[Interact with the statues]

Observation 15: That's not a verb I recognise.
