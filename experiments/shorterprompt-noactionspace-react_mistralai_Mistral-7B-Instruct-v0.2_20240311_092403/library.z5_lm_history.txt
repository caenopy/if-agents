(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

You are a student at Anycollege, in Anytown, and it's the end of the semester!  You've been slacking off all semester long, and it's catching up to you. That final paper is due for your Computer Science class ("The History of IF Games"), and you desperately need to check out a comprehensive book on Graham Nelson, one of the foremost authors of the obscure genre of interactive-fiction. You know there is exactly one such book, but you have no idea where it might be! 

The first time player should probably type "help".

ALL QUIET ON THE LIBRARY FRONT

Lobby
This is the entrance to the library. The circulation desk dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of desks and tables. A pair of security gates stands before the front doors to prevent people from stealing books. A card catalog lurks in a dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh flourescent light. Glass doors to the west lead to the book stacks; an archway to the northwest is labelled "Duplicating Services"; a door to the north bears a sign marked "Private" in large friendly letters; and the exit is to the east

You can see a circulation desk attendant here.

Thought 2: I will check the circulation desk to ask about the location of the book on Graham Nelson.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[ask circulation desk attendant about Graham Nelson book]

Observation 2: You can only do that to something animate.

Thought 3: I will check the card catalog to look up the location of the book on Graham Nelson.

Thought 4: I will check with the circulation desk attendant if they have any information about the location of the book on Graham Nelson.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[ask circulation desk attendant about Graham Nelson book]

Observation 4: You can only do that to something animate.

Thought 5: I will try to find a way to interact with the circulation desk attendant instead of directly asking them. For example, I could try to engage them in conversation first.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[approach circulation desk and greet attendant]

Observation 5: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 6: I will try to use a more specific action to approach the circulation desk and greet the attendant. For example, I could try "InteractiveFictionGame[approach circulation desk]" and then "InteractiveFictionGame[greet attendant]".

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[approach circulation desk], InteractiveFictionGame[greet attendant]

Observation 6: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

Thought 7: I must be standing in the wrong place to interact with the circulation desk attendant. I will go back to the lobby and try approaching the circulation desk again.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[approach circulation desk]

Observation 7: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 8: I will try to use a different approach to move towards the circulation desk. Instead of using the verb "approach", I will try "InteractiveFictionGame[go to circulation desk]".

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[go to circulation desk]

Observation 8: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 9: It seems that the game does not recognize the verb "go to" in this context. I will try using a different approach to move towards the circulation desk by using the verb "walk to" instead.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[walk to circulation desk]

Observation 9: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 10: It seems that the game does not recognize the verbs "go to" or "walk to" in this context for moving towards the circulation desk. I will try using a different approach by using the verb "enter" instead, as the description mentions that there are glass doors leading to the book stacks.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[enter book stacks]
