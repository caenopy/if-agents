This has never been your favorite part of the city.  Nor is this neighborhood the safest one.  But as a city sanitarian, you are charged with completing an annual health and safety inspection of every restaurant in your district.

Each day you visit three or four restaurants.  During those visits you take note of potential health code violations in your trusty notepad.  Today's first target:  Nikolai's Bar and Grill.

A hazy sun barely peeks above the three-story tenements.

Afflicted
An Interactive Fiction by Doug Egan
Release 1 / Serial number 080906 / Inform 7 build 5T18 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) 

Type "About" at any time to see game instructions and other notes from the author.

19th Street
You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street.  A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room.  The front entrance is north of you.

The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with broken bottles.  Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically.  A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak.

An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

A damp sheet of newspaper has blown up against the curb.

Annual Competition Version 

This game is intended to be enjoyed by both newcomers to IF and veteran players.  If you have never played interactive fiction, you are encouraged to return to the main menu and review the information under "General Instructions". 

Afflicted implements only a select number of new verbs.  The most important of these is the action "note".  Other changes should be obvious within the context of the game. "Ask" and "Tell" are synonyms in this game. Likewise "Give" and "Show". On the other hand, "Read" and "Examine" may give different responses for readable material.

The "Smell" action is fully implemented.  Each location has a unique odor.  A small number of individual objects also have their own odor.

type "Hint" to access the adaptive hint menu.

It is possible to end a game prematurely, sometimes in ways which can not be reversed by a single "undo" command.  Players are encouraged to save often and search for multiple alternate endings.

Annual Competition Version 

This game is intended to be enjoyed by both newcomers to IF and veteran players.  If you have never played interactive fiction, you are encouraged to return to the main menu and review the information under "General Instructions". 

Afflicted implements only a select number of new verbs.  The most important of these is the action "note".  Other changes should be obvious within the context of the game. "Ask" and "Tell" are synonyms in this game. Likewise "Give" and "Show". On the other hand, "Read" and "Examine" may give different responses for readable material.

The "Smell" action is fully implemented.  Each location has a unique odor.  A small number of individual objects also have their own odor.

type "Hint" to access the adaptive hint menu.

It is possible to end a game prematurely, sometimes in ways which can not be reversed by a single "undo" command.  Players are encouraged to save often and search for multiple alternate endings.
