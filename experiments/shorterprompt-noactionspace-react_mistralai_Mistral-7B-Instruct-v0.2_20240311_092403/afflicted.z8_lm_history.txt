You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Input: An instruction to play the game.

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I will start the interactive fiction game by taking the initial action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'. If the game ends or I die, I will use my experience to make a better choice in the next iteration.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
This has never been your favorite part of the city.  Nor is this neighborhood the safest one.  But as a city sanitarian, you are charged with completing an annual health and safety inspection of every restaurant in your district.

Each day you visit three or four restaurants.  During those visits you take note of potential health code violations in your trusty notepad.  Today's first target:  Nikolai's Bar and Grill.

A hazy sun barely peeks above the three-story tenements.

Afflicted
An Interactive Fiction by Doug Egan
Release 1 / Serial number 080906 / Inform 7 build 5T18 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) 

Type "About" at any time to see game instructions and other notes from the author.

19th Street
You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street.  A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room.  The front entrance is north of you.

The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with broken bottles.  Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically.  A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak.

An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

A damp sheet of newspaper has blown up against the curb.

Thought 2: I will check the placard on the front door of Nikolai's Bar and Grill for any important information, and then I will inspect the entrance and the surrounding area for potential health code violations.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Check placard]

Observation 2: An aluminum placard, printed in red, is fixed to the front door.

Thought 3: Based on the observation, I cannot read the content of the placard from this information. I will take the action to read the placard more closely.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Read placard]

Observation 3: You read: (in big red letters) CLOSED

Thought 4: Based on the observation, it seems that Nikolai's Bar and Grill is currently closed. I will make a note of this potential health code violation and move on to the next target for my inspection.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[Check inventory] (assuming the player has a notepad or inventory system to make notes) Thought 5: I will make a note in my inventory or notepad about the closed status of Nikolai's Bar and Grill.

Observation 4: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 5: Based on the observation, it seems that I do not have a notepad or inventory system to make notes. I will look for a place to buy or find one before continuing with my inspections.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[Explore surroundings for a place to buy or find a notepad or inventory system]

Observation 5: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 6: Based on the observation, it seems that the available actions are not sufficient to find or buy a notepad or inventory system. I will need to explore the game further to find a place or object that can provide me with this tool.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[Explore the neighborhood for a place to buy or find a notepad or inventory system]

Observation 6: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 7: Based on the observation, it seems that the available actions are not sufficient to explore the neighborhood specifically for a place to buy or find a notepad or inventory system. I will need to explore the game world more broadly and look for any clues or opportunities that may lead me to such an item.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[Explore the game world for a place to buy or find a notepad or inventory system]

Observation 7: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 8: Based on the observations, it seems that the game does not provide the necessary actions to find or buy a notepad or inventory system. I will need to explore the game world more thoroughly and look for any clues or opportunities that may lead me to such an item.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[Explore the game world]

Observation 8: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought 9: Based on the observations, it seems that the game does not provide the necessary actions to explore the game world or find a notepad or inventory system. I will need to read the game instructions or ask for help from the game author to understand how to progress in the game and complete my health and safety inspections effectively.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[About]

Observation 9: Instructions  N = NextQ = Quit Menu P = PreviousENTER = Selec

Thought 10: Based on the observation, it seems that I need to use the 'P' key to access the previous menu and then select the 'About' option to view the game instructions and other notes from the author.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[P], InteractiveFictionGame[About]

Observation 10: Instructions  N = NextQ = Quit Menu P = PreviousENTER = Selec

Thought 11: Based on the observation, it seems that I have successfully accessed the game instructions. I will read them carefully to find out how to progress in the game and complete my health and safety inspections effectively.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[Read instructions]

Observation 11: Instructions  N = NextQ = Quit Menu P = PreviousENTER = Selec

Thought 12: Based on the observation, it seems that I need to use the 'N' key to read the instructions one by one. I will do that until I find the information on how to progress in the game and complete my health and safety inspections effectively.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[N]

Observation 12: Instructions  N = NextQ = Quit Menu P = PreviousENTER = Selec

Thought 13: Based on the observation, it seems that I need to continue using the 'N' key to read the instructions until I find the information on how to progress in the game and complete my health and safety inspections effectively.

A short work of interactive horror 
Copyright 2008, Doug Egan 
Annual Competition Version 

This game is intended to be enjoyed by both newcomers to IF and veteran players.  If you have never played interactive fiction, you are encouraged to return to the main menu and review the information under "General Instructions". 

Afflicted implements only a select number of new verbs.  The most important of these is the action "note".  Other changes should be obvious within the context of the game. "Ask" and "Tell" are synonyms in this game. Likewise "Give" and "Show". On the other hand, "Read" and "Examine" may give different responses for readable material.

The "Smell" action is fully implemented.  Each location has a unique odor.  A small number of individual objects also have their own odor.

type "Hint" to access the adaptive hint menu.

It is possible to end a game prematurely, sometimes in ways which can not be reversed by a single "undo" command.  Players are encouraged to save often and search for multiple alternate endings.



Please press SPACE to continue.

Thought 14: Based on the observation, it seems that I have found the information on how to progress in the game by using the "note" verb to make notes about potential health code violations. I will now continue with my health and safety inspections at the next target.
