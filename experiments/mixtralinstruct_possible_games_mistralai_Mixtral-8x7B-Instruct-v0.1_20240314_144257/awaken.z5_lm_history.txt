You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: observations based on action

Reflect: self reflection on your progress and strategy taken thus far

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'] or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
You remember darkness. And the cold. Cold and darkness. And silence. Those memories are all that you have. That, and a feeling that something you never knew you possessed has been lost.

Suddenly, oblivion is split by a blinding light and a crash of sound. You awaken to the roar of a storm and a deluge of rain and mud.

In the Mud
Rain and muddy water are pouring down on you, making it difficult to see or even breathe. Sodden earth and mud surrounds you on all sides except overhead, where flashes of lightning illuminate a storm tossed sky.

Thought: It seems that I have started a new game and I am in a location called "The Mud". The description suggests that it is raining and muddy, making it difficult to see or breathe. There are no explicit instructions or objectives given, but it seems that I need to find a way to get out of this situation.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[look around]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought: It seems that the command "look around" is not recognized by the game. I will try using a more simple command to get a description of my surroundings.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine]

Observation:
(yourself)
You find you cannot look down at yourself. It is almost as if you know what you might find and are afraid to have your fears confirmed.

Thought: It seems that I cannot examine myself directly. This could mean that my character has some sort of limitation or injury that I am not aware of. I will try examining my surroundings instead to see if there are any clues or objects that I can interact with.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine surroundings]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Reflect: Reflection: It seems that the game has a specific syntax for examining things. I will need to be more precise in my commands. I will also need to pay attention to any details in the descriptions that might hint at how to interact with the environment. So far, I have not found any objects or clues that I can use to progress, so I will continue to explore and examine my surroundings.

Thought: I will try using more specific commands to examine my surroundings and look for any objects or clues that I can interact with. I will also try moving to different locations to see if the environment changes and if there are any new objects or clues that I can interact with.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine mud]

Observation: The sides of the hole are made of dark, rich earth, now soaked through by the torrential downpour.  As you watch, more and more mud is washed away and into the hole with you.

Thought: It seems that I am in a hole filled with mud and rain. The mud is being washed away by the rain, which suggests that I need to find a way to get out of the hole before I am buried in it. I will try to look for any objects or features in the hole that I can use to climb out.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine hole]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that I cannot directly examine the hole. However, the description of the hole suggests that it is made of "dark, rich earth". This could mean that I might be able to climb out of the hole using the sides. I will try to move in different directions to see if I can find a way to climb out.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go up]

Observation:
As you scramble out of the hole the mud collapses downward, filling in the hole behind you.

Graveyard
Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The only exit is through the gate to the east.

A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the graveyard.

A large branch has been broken from one of the trees and has crushed the grave marker below it.

Thought: It seems that I have successfully climbed out of the hole and I am now in a graveyard. The description suggests that the graveyard is old and decaying, with an iron barred fence surrounding it and a church to the east. There is also a large branch that has broken off a tree and crushed a grave marker. There are no explicit instructions or objectives given, but it seems that I need to find a way to get out of the graveyard and possibly enter the church. I will try to look for any objects or features in the graveyard that I can interact with and possibly use to progress.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine fence]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that I cannot directly examine the fence. However, the description suggests that it is an "iron barred fence" which implies that it might be sturdy and difficult to pass through. I will try to look for any objects or features in the graveyard that I can interact with and possibly use to progress.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine tree]

Observation: These ancient, twisted trees surround and even invade the graveyard. Now tossed wildly by the storm, their branches reach skyward while their roots suck unholy nourishment from between the broken slabs.

Reflect: Reflection: I have now successfully climbed out of the hole and I am in a graveyard. I have explored the graveyard and found that there is an iron barred fence surrounding it and a church to the east. The graveyard is old and decaying, with an odor of decay hanging over everything. I have not found any objects or features that I can interact with yet, so I will continue to explore and examine my surroundings. I will also keep in mind the obstacle of the iron barred fence and look for a way to pass through it or find an alternative exit.

Thought: I will continue to explore the graveyard and look for any objects or features that I can interact with. I will also look for any clues or hints that might suggest a way to progress. Additionally, I will keep in mind the obstacle of the iron barred fence and look for a way to pass through it or find an alternative exit.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine church]

Observation:
The old church has seen better days. Formerly painted white, the boards are now faded, peeling and rotted. Most of the windows are boarded up, and those that aren't have long since been broken out. The shingles have fallen from the roof, which sags alarmingly. A broken-tipped steeple rises from one end of the building, and a faint miasma of decay seems to rise from the structure.

Lightning arcs overhead, followed instantly by a blast of thunder.

Thought: It seems that the church is an old and decaying building with broken windows, a sagging roof, and a broken-tipped steeple. The description suggests that it might be difficult to enter the church due to its condition. However, it could also be a potential objective or location of interest, so I will look for a way to enter it.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine boards]

Observation: Once, the windows were probably told stories of hope and redemption in brightly colored stained glass. Now, they are boarded up as if the church has closed it's eyes to the world outside.

Thought: It seems that the windows of the church are boarded up, which implies that they are not currently accessible. This could mean that I need to find another way to enter the church, such as through a door or another entrance. I will continue to explore the graveyard and look for any objects or features that I can interact with, including the church itself.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine grave marker]

Observation: The marker for this grave has been shattered by the fall of a large branch from the overhanging tree. The grave itself has been disturbed; the soil has fallen in to form a shallow pit.

Thought: It seems that one of the grave markers has been shattered by a large branch and the grave itself has been disturbed, forming a shallow pit. This could be an opportunity to interact with the environment and possibly find a useful object or clue. I will examine the pit and see if I can find anything of interest.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine pit]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that I cannot directly examine the pit. However, the description suggests that the grave has been disturbed and the soil has fallen in to form a shallow pit.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[dig pit]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Reflect: Reflection: I have now successfully climbed out of the hole and I am in a graveyard. I have explored the graveyard and found that there is an iron barred fence surrounding it and a church to the east. The graveyard is old and decaying, with an odor of decay hanging over everything. I have found a disturbed grave with a shallow pit, but I have not been able to interact with it directly. I will try to find a tool or object that I can use to dig the pit and possibly find something of interest. I will also keep in mind the obstacle of the iron barred fence and look for a way to pass through it or find an alternative exit.

Thought: I will continue to explore the graveyard and look for any objects or tools that I can use to dig the pit and possibly find something of interest. I will also look for any clues or hints that might suggest a way to progress. Additionally, I will keep in mind the obstacle of the iron barred fence and look for a way to pass through it or find an alternative exit.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine ground]

Observation: A thin layer of mud covers the rocky soil.

Thought: It seems that the ground is covered with a thin layer of mud. This could make it difficult to find any objects or tools that I can use to dig the pit. However, I will continue to explore the graveyard and look for any objects or tools that I can use. I will also look for any clues or hints that might suggest a way to progress. Additionally, I will keep in mind the obstacle of the iron barred fence and look for a way to pass through it or find an alternative exit.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine area around the grave]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that I cannot directly examine the area around the grave. However, the previous observations suggest that there is a large branch that has broken off a tree and crushed a grave marker, creating a shallow pit in the disturbed grave. The ground is covered with a thin layer of mud, which could make it difficult to find any objects or tools that I can use to dig the pit. I will continue to explore the graveyard and look for any objects or tools that I can use. I will also look for any clues or hints that might suggest a way to progress.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine objects]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that I cannot directly examine "objects" in the game. This could mean that there are no objects in my immediate vicinity, or that I need to be more specific in my command. I will try using a more specific command to look for objects or tools that I can use to dig the pit.
