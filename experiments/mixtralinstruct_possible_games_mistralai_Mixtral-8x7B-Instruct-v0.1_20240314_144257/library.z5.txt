You are a student at Anycollege, in Anytown, and it's the end of the semester!  You've been slacking off all semester long, and it's catching up to you. That final paper is due for your Computer Science class ("The History of IF Games"), and you desperately need to check out a comprehensive book on Graham Nelson, one of the foremost authors of the obscure genre of interactive-fiction. You know there is exactly one such book, but you have no idea where it might be! 

The first time player should probably type "help".

Lobby
This is the entrance to the library. The circulation desk dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of desks and tables. A pair of security gates stands before the front doors to prevent people from stealing books. A card catalog lurks in a dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh flourescent light. Glass doors to the west lead to the book stacks; an archway to the northwest is labelled "Duplicating Services"; a door to the north bears a sign marked "Private" in large friendly letters; and the exit is to the east

You can see a circulation desk attendant here.
> Check card catalog
Almost no light penetrates this corner of the room. The card catalog is in the usual shape, a box on legs with a myriad of small drawers, each labelled in crabbed writing. However, the entire card catalog is festooned with cobwebs. The dust on top is so thick that it looks like grubby grey felt.
> Look for a drawer with information about Graham Nelson or interactive fiction
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> Open the drawers and look for information about Graham Nelson or interactive fiction
You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
> Look for information about Graham Nelson
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> Check for Graham Nelson
You can't see any such thing.
> Go west
You push the glass doors open. Their hydraulics hiss faintly.

Ground Floor Stacks
This cavernous room is lit with flickering flourescent lighting which makes the ceiling look even lower than it really is. It is filled with half-empty shelves, upon which rest the dusty boxes of many early games. To one side sits a massive, ancient desk, its surface cluttered with paperwork. A sign on the wall indicates that this is the reference desk, which would make the prim young woman sitting behind it the reference librarian. A doorway to the north is labelled "Stairs", and glass doors lead east to the lobby.

You can see a reference librarian here.
> Ask the reference librarian about the book on Graham Nelson
"What sort of book?  We have many books here!"
> The book is called 'Graham Nelson: A Comprehensive Guide to His Works'
That's not a verb I recognise.
> I am looking for a book on Graham Nelson
I only understood you as far as wanting to inventory.
> Check for a book on Graham Nelson
You can't see any such thing.
> Ask the reference librarian if they know where I might find a book on Graham Nelson or interactive f
I didn't understand that sentence.

You can't go that way.

Duplicating Services
This is the copier room. There is only one copier here, and it bears a sign which proclaims it to be out of order. The tangled mess of wires spilling out of its mechanical belly reinforces the statement.

You can see a copier technician here.

The technician kicks the copier, muttering under his breath.
> Go south
Maybe you should go out through the doors to the southeast.

The technician pulls out a piece of wire and adds it to the collection.
> Go out through the doors to the southeast
You can't see any such thing.
> Go east
Maybe you should go out through the doors to the southeast.

The repairman yelps as he touches the wrong wire, and with an ear-splitting *POP*, vanishes in a cloud of greasy smoke...

Looks like there's no chance of getting a copy made now.....

Maybe you should go out through the doors to the southeast.

Maybe you should go out through the doors to the southeast.
