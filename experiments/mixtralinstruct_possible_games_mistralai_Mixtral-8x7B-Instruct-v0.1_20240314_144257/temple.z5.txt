Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.

Void
You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner.
> Explore
That's not a verb I recognise.
> Look

You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner. 

A cascade of red colour explodes below you.
> Move towards the red cascade
You can't see any such thing.
> Look around
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> Examine
What do you want to examine?
> Examine the void
You can't see any such thing.
> Move up
You are unable to.

Suddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long.
> Examine the shape
In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.

The shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.

Roof
The city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star-filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down.
> Move towards the winding staircase
You can't see any such thing.
> Move north
You are unable to.
> Move south
You are unable to.
> Examine the iron railing
The most spectacular thing about the railing is the small statues decorating it. The artist must have used his most morbid fantasies for inspiration when carving these monsters, yet they are realistic to minute detail.

> Move to the edge of the roof
You can't see any such thing.
> Move to the winding staircase
You can't see any such thing.
> Examine the roof
Judging from the masonry the tower must be centuries old. It towers high above the nightmarish city below.

You see nothing special about the north wall.
> Examine south
You see nothing special about the south wall.
> Search
What do you want to search?
> Search the roof
You find nothing of interest.
> Move west
You are unable to.
> Move east
You are unable to.
> Climb down
I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
> Jump
Terrified you may be, but not yet ready to commit suicide.
