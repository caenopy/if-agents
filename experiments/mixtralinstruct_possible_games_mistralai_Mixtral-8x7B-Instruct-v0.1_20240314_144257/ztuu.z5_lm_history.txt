You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: observations based on action

Reflect: self reflection on your progress and strategy taken thus far

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'] or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you."

"What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly.

"Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages."

"And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully.

"A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever.

"But what of Kolchack the --"

"Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!"  He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!"

And with that, you embark on...

New Excavation
You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am starting a text-based adventure game called "Zork: The Undiscovered Underground". I am at the entrance of a narrow tunnel with a brass lantern and a plastic sword. My goal is to explore the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire and bring back news of what lies there. I will start by going northeast into the tunnel, as that is the direction the tunnel winds.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go northeast]

Observation:
As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!

Tunnel
You are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.

Thought: I was not expecting the tunnel to collapse behind me. This changes my situation significantly. I am now trapped in the tunnel and must find another way out. Based on the observation, I will continue to go northeast, as that is the only direction I can go. I will also keep an eye out for any alternate paths or exits, as well as any objects or tools that might help me escape.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go northeast]

Observation:
Cultural Complex
This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period."  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription "Convention Center."  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science."

Thought: I have entered a new area called the "Cultural Complex", which seems to be the center of the GUE's cultural center. The area is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period" and there are several paths I can take. I will explore each path and gather more information about each one before deciding which direction to take. I will also look for any objects or tools that might help me escape the tunnel.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[look at the sign]

Observation: The sign indicates today's performance, which (in honor of the festivities in the Convention Center) is "A Massacre on 34th Street."

Reflect: Reflection: I have made it to the Cultural Complex and found several paths to explore. I have also found a sign indicating today's performance. I have not encountered any obstacles or challenges yet, but I will continue to explore and gather information before making any decisions. I have not yet used the brass lantern or the plastic sword, but I will keep them in mind as potential tools to help me escape the tunnel or progress in the game. I will also continue to reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Thought: I will continue to explore each path and gather more information about each one before deciding which direction to take. I will also look for any objects or tools that might help me escape the tunnel.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go north under the inscription "Convention Center"]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to go the north wall.

Thought: I will try to be more specific with my command.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go north through the large hallway passing under the inscription "Convention Center"]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to go the north wall.

Thought: It seems like the game is not recognizing my command to go north through the large hallway. I will try a different approach.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[look]

A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science."

Thought: It seems that I can't go north through the large hallway for some reason. I will try exploring the other paths instead. I will go east under the fifty-story triumphal arch and see where that leads me.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go east under the fifty-story triumphal arch]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to go the east wall.

Thought: It seems like the game is not recognizing my command to go east under the fifty-story triumphal arch. I will try being more specific with my command.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go east through the passageway under the fifty-story triumphal arch]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to go the east wall.

Reflect: Reflection: I have encountered some difficulty in navigating the game. Despite my efforts to be specific with my commands, the game does not seem to recognize certain directions. I will try using more simple and direct commands to see if that helps. I will also continue to explore and gather information before making any decisions. I have not yet used the brass lantern or the plastic sword, but I will keep them in mind as potential tools to help me escape the tunnel or progress in the game. I will also continue to reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Thought: I will try using more simple and direct commands to see if that helps. I will start by going east through the passageway.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation:
Theater
This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.

Thought: I have successfully navigated to the Theater, which is a large auditorium with 69,105 seats and a long aisle running from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. There are also narrow aisles arranged in a "maze of twisty passages" style, which I have been advised to avoid. I will explore the oversized stage to the east and see if there are any exits or objects of interest there. I will also keep an eye out for any alternate paths or exits, as well as any objects or tools that might help me escape the tunnel.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go east to the oversized stage]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to go the east wall.

Thought: It seems like the game is having trouble understanding my command to go to the oversized stage. I will try using a more simple and direct command.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation:
Stage
The rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.)  As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle.

Thought: I have successfully navigated to the stage, which has a large proscenium and a maroon curtain leading backstage. There is also a row of brightly colored footlights and a set of stairs leading back down into the theater's main aisle. I will explore backstage and see if there are any exits or objects of interest there. I will also keep an eye out for any alternate paths or exits, as well as any objects or tools that might help me escape the tunnel.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go backstage]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that there is no "backstage" area that I can go to from the stage. I will try exploring the theater's main aisle instead, as there might be exits or objects of interest there.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go down the stairs into the theater's main aisle]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to go down the stairs.

Reflect: Reflection: I have encountered some difficulty in navigating the game. Despite my efforts to be specific with my commands, the game does not seem to recognize certain directions. I will try using even more simple and direct commands to see if that helps. I will also continue to explore and gather information before making any decisions.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[down]

Observation: Theater

Thought: I have successfully navigated down the stairs into the theater's main aisle. I will take some time to look around and see if there are any exits or objects of interest here. I will also keep an eye out for any alternate paths or exits, as well as any objects or tools that might help me escape the tunnel.

Thought: Based on the observation, I don't see any new exits or objects of interest in the theater. I will go back up the stairs and explore the other paths in the Cultural Complex. I will start by going south into the Hall of Science and see if there are any exits or objects of interest there.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Observation: Stage

Thought: I have successfully navigated back up to the stage. I will go south into the Hall of Science and see if there are any exits or objects of interest there.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation: As previously noted, the wings are blocked by rubble and debris.

Thought: It seems that the wings of the stage are blocked by rubble and debris, so I cannot go that way. I will explore the Hall of Science and see if there are any exits or objects of interest there.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation: As previously noted, the wings are blocked by rubble and debris.

Thought: It seems that I am still on the stage and the game is not recognizing my command to go south into the Hall of Science. I will try using the `examine` command to see if there is any additional information about the stage that might help me progress.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine stage]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that the `examine` command is not recognized in this game. I will try using a more simple and direct command to go south into the Hall of Science.

Observation:
Backstage
Ah... ah... choo! Those curtains! If I weren't so busy helping you with this game, I'd suggest you go on without me and let me clean this place up enough so that when you returned, I could at least describe it decently. I'll do the best I can, though. A thick, maroon curtain separates the backstage area from the stage. This area was obviously the target of a small, underground tornado (a Vorx) as scrims, scenery and costumes litter the floor. 

Even an old steamer trunk, virtually decaying from age, rests in a corner.

Thought: I have successfully navigated east under the fifty-story triumphal arch and entered the backstage area. It seems to be a cluttered and disorganized space, with a thick, maroon curtain separating it from the stage. There are various items scattered around, including scrims, scenery, costumes, and an old steamer trunk. I will explore the area further and see if there are any exits or objects of interest. I will also look for any tools or resources that might help me escape the tunnel or progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[look at the old steamer trunk]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that the game is not recognizing my command to look at the old steamer trunk. I will try using a more simple and direct command.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine trunk]

Observation: This is a theatrical trunk, with many exotic travel stickers on it. Its locking leather straps have long since decayed.

Thought: I have successfully examined the old steamer trunk and found that it is a theatrical trunk with many exotic travel stickers on it. The locking leather straps have decayed, so it is possible to open it and look inside. I will do this to see if there are any useful items or tools inside that might help me escape the tunnel or progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[open the trunk]

Observation: Phew! Now that's musty! The trunk, beside hiding an invisible dead elephant (what else could produce that smell?), holds a rare quint-Zorkmid coin.

Thought: I have opened the theatrical trunk and found that it contains a rare quint-Zorkmid coin. This coin might be valuable or have some use later in the game. I will take the coin and add it to my inventory. I will also continue to explore the backstage area and look for any other exits or objects of interest.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[take the coin]

Observation:
Taken.
