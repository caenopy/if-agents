You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Observation: observations based on action

Reflect: self reflection on your progress and strategy taken thus far

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'] or, when done, Finish[answer]

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game.

<< Chief's office >>
You are standing in the Chief's office. He is telling you "The Mayor was murdered yeaterday night at 12:03 am. I want you to solve it before we get any bad publicity or the FBI has to come in. "Yessir!" You reply. He hands you a sheet of paper. Once you have read it, go north or west.

You can see a piece of white paper here.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

Thought: Based on the observation, I am in the Chief's office and have been tasked with solving a murder. The Chief has given me some information, which I assume is important for solving the case. I will take the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Read paper]' to read the paper and gather more information.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Read paper]

Observation:
CONFIDENTIAL:
Detective was created by Matt Barringer.
He has worked hard on this so you better enjoy it.
I did have fun making it though. But I'd REALLY appreciate it if you were kind enough to send a postcard or... dare I even say it?... money... to:
Matt Barringer
325 Olive Ave
Piedmont
CA 94611
Just tell me if you like it or not.
If you want to talk to me over a BBS call the Ghostbuster Central BBS at (510)208-5657.
There is an Exile Games file area. Have fun. I WILL give hints out over the BBS to any of my games.

Thought: Based on the observation, the paper I read appears to be a message from the game's creator, Matt Barringer, rather than information related to the murder case. It does provide some interesting background information and contact details, but it doesn't seem to be directly helpful in solving the case. I will continue to explore my surroundings and look for clues.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that I need to specify what I want to look at. I will look at the piece of white paper that I can see in the room.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look at paper]

Observation: It is a piece of white paper.

Reflect: Reflect: After reading the paper and looking around the room, I have not found any direct clues related to the murder case. I have gathered some background information about the game's creator, but that is not my main objective. I will continue to explore the room and interact with objects to find any potential clues.

Thought: Based on the observation, I have looked at the piece of white paper, but it does not provide any useful information. I will now look at the Chief to see if he has any additional information or instructions for me.

Reflect: Reflect: After examining the room and the Chief, and then exploring the outside area, I have not found any direct clues related to the murder case.

I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.
