You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: observations based on action

Reflect: self reflection on your progress and strategy taken thus far

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'] or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Large Clearing
You are standing in a large clearing surrounded by a dense forest.  There is a path to the east.

You can see a tree here.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am in a large clearing surrounded by a dense forest with a path to the east. There is also a tree in this location. My goal is to explore the game and its mechanics, gather information about my surroundings and objectives, and collect useful items. Therefore, I will take the path to the east and explore in that direction.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation:
Small Path
The path branches here.  There are paths to the west and south that continue into the forest.  The path to the east appears to lead into some rather rocky territory.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am at a path branch with options to go west, south, or east into rocky territory. I will explore the path to the west first, as it is the first option available to me.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation:
Large Clearing

You can see a tree here.

Thought: Based on the observation, I have returned to the large clearing. This could be an indication that the path to the west led back to this location. However, I should still explore the path to the south before deciding on my next steps.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go south]

Observation: You can't go that way.

Reflect: Reflection: I have taken three steps so far and have encountered a path branch with options to go west, south, or east into rocky territory. I explored the path to the west and found that it led back to the large clearing. I attempted to go south but was unable to do so. Therefore, my next best option is to explore the path to the east, which leads into some rocky territory.

Thought: Based on my reflection, I will explore the path to the east, which leads into some rocky territory. This could potentially lead to new locations and objectives.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation: Small Path

Thought: Based on the observation, I am now on a small path that leads into some rocky territory. I will continue to explore this path and see where it leads.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation:
Canyon Entrance
This is the entrance to a canyon formed by an ancient river.  The canyon is to the east.  There is a sandy path to the northwest that seems to lead to a beach.  There is a path leading into a forest to the west.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am at the entrance of a canyon formed by an ancient river. There are two paths available to me: one leading to the east into the canyon, and another leading to the northwest towards a beach. I will explore the path to the northwest first, as it is the first option available to me.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go northwest]

Observation:
Endless Beach
This is a beach that seems to stretch on forever to the east and west.  There is nothing particularly notable about the beach, except that it has white sand.  The ocean is to the north.  You see an island on the horizon.  There is a path winding across the dunes to the southeast.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am at an endless beach with white sand and an island on the horizon. There is a path winding across the dunes to the southeast. I will explore the path to the southeast and see where it leads.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go southeast]

Observation: Canyon Entrance

Thought: Based on the observation, I have returned to the canyon entrance. This could be an indication that the path to the southeast led back to this location. However, I have not yet explored the path leading into the forest to the west. Therefore, I will explore that path next.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation: Small Path

Reflect: Reflection: I have taken 10 steps so far and have explored a large clearing, a path branch, and an endless beach. I have also encountered a canyon entrance and a forest path. I have not yet encountered any obstacles or challenges, but I have been able to gather information about my surroundings and objectives. I have also been able to collect the experience of returning to previous locations, which will be useful in avoiding dead ends and making better choices. Therefore, I will continue to explore the path leading into the forest to the west and see where it takes me.

Thought: Based on my reflection, I will explore the path leading into the forest to the west. This could potentially lead to new locations and objectives.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation:
Large Clearing

You can see a tree here.

Thought: Based on the observation, I have returned to the large clearing. This could be an indication that the path to the west led back to this location. However, I have not yet explored the tree in this location. Therefore, I will examine the tree and see if it provides any useful information or items.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine tree]

Observation: There is a snorkel hanging from the tree.  You take it.

Thought: Based on the observation, I have found a snorkel hanging from the tree, which I have taken. This could be a useful item for exploring underwater locations. I will continue to explore the game and keep an eye out for any bodies of water where I can use this snorkel.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation: Small Path

Thought: Based on the observation, I am now on a small path that leads into some rocky territory. I will continue to explore this path and see where it leads.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation: Canyon Entrance

Thought: Based on the observation, I am back at the entrance of the canyon. I will explore the path to the east, which leads into the canyon.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation:
Canyon Path
The path here is a riverbed that has long since gone dry.  The river has cut several meandering passages into the canyon, forming what looks like two rather large boulders.  A passage to the north appears to go around the larger boulder, while a narrow gap to the southeast seems to go around the smaller boulder.  A passage to the east cuts the rock into its separate sections.  And of course, the passage to the west goes back the way you came.

Reflect: Reflection: I have taken 15 steps so far and have explored a large clearing, a path branch, an endless beach, a canyon entrance, and a canyon path. I have encountered a few path options and have been able to gather information about my surroundings and objectives. I have also been able to collect a useful item, the snorkel, which I found hanging from a tree. I have not yet encountered any major obstacles or challenges, but I have been able to use my reasoning skills to make informed decisions about which paths to explore. Therefore, I will continue to explore the canyon path and see where the different passages lead.

Thought: Based on my reflection, I will explore the passage to the north, which goes around the larger boulder. This could potentially lead to new locations and objectives.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation:
Small Clearing
This clearing is apparently a brief widening of some ancient river.  There are various small passages winding around two large boulders.  These are to the north, south, and west.

You can see a shovel here.

Thought: Based on the observation, I have reached a small clearing with passages to the north, south, and west, and there is a shovel present in this location. I will take the shovel, as it could be a useful tool for solving puzzles or overcoming obstacles. I will then explore the passage to the north, as it is the first option available to me.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Take shovel], InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that I cannot take the shovel, possibly because it is not within my reach or I am unable to interact with it. I will proceed to explore the passage to the north and see where it leads.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation: Canyon Path

Thought: Based on the observation, I am back on the canyon path. I will explore the narrow gap to the southeast, as it seems like a new path that I haven't taken before.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go southeast]

Observation:
Small Clearing

You can see a shovel here.

Thought: Based on the observation, I have reached another small clearing with a shovel present. This time, I will make sure to describe the action of taking the shovel more specifically, so that the game understands my intention.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Take the shovel]

Observation: Taken.

Reflect: Reflection: I have taken 20 steps so far and have explored a large clearing, a path branch, an endless beach, a canyon entrance, a canyon path, and two small clearings. I have encountered a few path options and have been able to gather information about my surroundings and objectives. I have also been able to collect two useful items, the snorkel and the shovel, which I found hanging from a tree and in two small clearings, respectively. I have not yet encountered any major obstacles or challenges, but I have been able to use my reasoning skills to make informed decisions about which paths to explore. I have also learned from my mistakes, such as when I was unable to take the shovel the first time due to an unspecific command. Therefore, I will continue to explore the game and use my experience to make better choices.

Thought: Based on my reflection, I will explore the passage to the east, which cuts the rock into its separate sections. This could potentially lead to new locations and objectives.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation: You can't go that way.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that I cannot go east at this location. I will explore the passage to the south instead, which goes around the smaller boulder.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go south]

Observation: Canyon Path

Thought: Based on the observation, I am back on the canyon path. I will explore the passage to the east, which cuts the rock into its separate sections. This is the same thought as before, but I am adjusting my strategy based on the new information that I cannot go east from the previous location.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation: Small Clearing

Thought: Based on the observation, I have reached a small clearing. There are no new paths or items to interact with, so I will go back to the canyon path and explore the other passages. I will go west, as it is the unexplored passage.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation: Canyon Path

Thought: Based on the observation, I am back on the canyon path. I have explored all the passages that are immediately available, so I will go back to the small clearing where I found the shovel and explore the passage to the south.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go south]

Observation: You can't go that way.

Reflect: Reflection: I have taken 25 steps so far and have explored a large clearing, a path branch, an endless beach, a canyon entrance, a canyon path, and three small clearings. I have encountered a few path options and have been able to gather information about my surroundings and objectives. I have also been able to collect two useful items, the snorkel and the shovel, which I found hanging from a tree and in two small clearings, respectively. I have not yet encountered any major obstacles or challenges, but I have been able to use my reasoning skills to make informed decisions about which paths to explore. I have also learned from my mistakes, such as when I was unable to take the shovel the first time due to an unspecific command. However, I have encountered a dead end and was unable to go south from the small clearing. Therefore, I will retrace my steps and try a different path.

Thought: Based on my reflection, I will go back to the canyon path and explore the passage to the west, which goes around the larger boulder. This could potentially lead to new locations and objectives.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation: Canyon Entrance

Thought: Based on the observation, I am back at the entrance of the canyon. I will explore the path to the west, which leads back to the large clearing. From there, I can try a different path and see where it takes me.
