You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: observations based on action

Reflect: self reflection on your progress and strategy taken thus far

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'] or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

You are a student at Anycollege, in Anytown, and it's the end of the semester!  You've been slacking off all semester long, and it's catching up to you. That final paper is due for your Computer Science class ("The History of IF Games"), and you desperately need to check out a comprehensive book on Graham Nelson, one of the foremost authors of the obscure genre of interactive-fiction. You know there is exactly one such book, but you have no idea where it might be! 

The first time player should probably type "help".

Lobby
This is the entrance to the library. The circulation desk dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of desks and tables. A pair of security gates stands before the front doors to prevent people from stealing books. A card catalog lurks in a dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh flourescent light. Glass doors to the west lead to the book stacks; an archway to the northwest is labelled "Duplicating Services"; a door to the north bears a sign marked "Private" in large friendly letters; and the exit is to the east

You can see a circulation desk attendant here.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am a student who needs to find a comprehensive book on Graham Nelson for my Computer Science class. I am currently in the lobby of the library, which has a circulation desk, security gates, a card catalog, book stacks, duplicating services, a private room, and an exit. I can see a circulation desk attendant here. To proceed, I will explore the library and look for the book. I will start by checking the card catalog to see if I can find any information about the book's location.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Check card catalog]

Observation: Almost no light penetrates this corner of the room. The card catalog is in the usual shape, a box on legs with a myriad of small drawers, each labelled in crabbed writing. However, the entire card catalog is festooned with cobwebs. The dust on top is so thick that it looks like grubby grey felt.

Thought: Based on the observation, the card catalog is old and covered in dust and cobwebs, which suggests that it may not be used frequently. This could make it difficult to find the information I need. However, I will still try to search the catalog for any information about the book's location. I will start by looking for a drawer that might contain information about books on Graham Nelson or interactive fiction.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look for a drawer with information about Graham Nelson or interactive fiction]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that I need to specify my action more clearly. I will try to open the drawers and look for the specific information I need.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Open the drawers and look for information about Graham Nelson or interactive fiction]

Observation: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

Reflect: Reflection: It seems that the game's parser is not able to understand my command to open the drawers and look for information about Graham Nelson or interactive fiction. I need to find a way to simplify my command and make it more clear.

Thought: I will try to simplify my command and just look for information about Graham Nelson without specifying the card catalog.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look for information about Graham Nelson]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that the game's parser is still not able to understand my command. I need to find a way to make my command even more simple and clear.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Check for Graham Nelson]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that the card catalog does not have any information about Graham Nelson. This could mean that the book is not available in the library, or that it is located in a different section. I will try to explore other areas of the library to see if I can find the book. I will start by checking the book stacks to the west.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation:
You push the glass doors open. Their hydraulics hiss faintly.

Ground Floor Stacks
This cavernous room is lit with flickering flourescent lighting which makes the ceiling look even lower than it really is. It is filled with half-empty shelves, upon which rest the dusty boxes of many early games. To one side sits a massive, ancient desk, its surface cluttered with paperwork. A sign on the wall indicates that this is the reference desk, which would make the prim young woman sitting behind it the reference librarian. A doorway to the north is labelled "Stairs", and glass doors lead east to the lobby.

You can see a reference librarian here.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am now in the Ground Floor Stacks, which has flickering fluorescent lighting and is filled with half-empty shelves. There is a massive, ancient desk with paperwork and a sign indicating that it is the reference desk. A prim young woman sitting behind it is the reference librarian. There are stairs to the north and glass doors leading east to the lobby. To proceed, I will ask the reference librarian if they know where the book on Graham Nelson is located.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Ask the reference librarian about the book on Graham Nelson]

Observation: "What sort of book?  We have many books here!"

Thought: Based on the observation, the reference librarian is asking for more information about the book. I will provide the title and author of the book.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[The book is called 'Graham Nelson: A Comprehensive Guide to His Works']

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Reflect: Reflection: It seems that the game's parser is not recognizing my input as a valid command. I need to find a way to rephrase my command in a way that the game can understand.

Thought: I will try to rephrase my command and simply tell the reference librarian that I am looking for a book on Graham Nelson.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[I am looking for a book on Graham Nelson]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to inventory.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that the game's parser is still not recognizing my input as a valid command. I need to find a way to rephrase my command in a way that the game can understand.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Check for a book on Graham Nelson]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that the library does not have the book on Graham Nelson. I could try asking the reference librarian if they know where I might find a book on Graham Nelson or interactive fiction. If they do not know, I could try checking other areas of the library, such as the duplicating services or the private room. If I still cannot find the book, I may need to consider alternative sources, such as interlibrary loan or purchasing the book myself.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Ask the reference librarian if they know where I might find a book on Graham Nelson or interactive fiction]

Observation: I didn't understand that sentence.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that the game's parser is still not recognizing my input as a valid command. I need to find a way to rephrase my command in a way that the game can understand.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Do you know where I can find a book on Graham Nelson or interactive fiction?]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that the game's parser is not recognizing my input as a valid command. I need to find a way to rephrase my command in a way that the game can understand.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Check with the reference librarian for a book on Graham Nelson or interactive fiction]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Reflect: Reflection: It seems that I am having difficulty communicating with the reference librarian and finding the information I need. I need to find a way to rephrase my command in a way that the game can understand and that will elicit a helpful response from the reference librarian.

Thought: I will try to rephrase my command and simply ask the reference librarian if they know where I can find a book on Graham Nelson or interactive fiction.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Do you know where I can find a book on Graham Nelson or interactive fiction?]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Ask the reference librarian for help finding a book on Graham Nelson or interactive fiction]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that the game's parser is still not recognizing my input as a valid command. I have tried several different ways of asking the reference librarian for help finding the book, but none of them have been successful. At this point, I am not sure how to proceed. I could try asking for help in a more general way, or I could try exploring other areas of the library. However, I am concerned that I may not be able to find the book I need in this library.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go northwest]

Observation: You can't go that way.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that I cannot go northwest from my current location. I will try to explore other areas of the library to see if I can find the book. I will start by going west to the book stacks.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation: You can't go that way.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that I cannot go west from my current location. I will try to explore other areas of the library to see if I can find the book. I will start by going east to the lobby.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation:

You can see a circulation desk attendant here.

Reflect: Reflection: I have now returned to the lobby, after unsuccessfully trying to go west and northwest from the reference desk. I have asked the reference librarian for help finding a book on Graham Nelson or interactive fiction, but the game's parser has not recognized my input as a valid command. I am not sure how to proceed, as I am unable to find the book I need in this library. I will try exploring other areas of the library, such as Duplicating Services or the Private room, to see if I can find the book. If I still cannot find the book, I may need to consider alternative sources, such as interlibrary loan or purchasing the book myself.

Thought: I will try to go northwest to Duplicating Services and see if I can find the book there.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go northwest]

Observation:
Duplicating Services
This is the copier room. There is only one copier here, and it bears a sign which proclaims it to be out of order. The tangled mess of wires spilling out of its mechanical belly reinforces the statement.

You can see a copier technician here.

The technician kicks the copier, muttering under his breath.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am now in the Duplicating Services room, which has an out-of-order copier and a copier technician who is trying to fix it. There does not appear to be any books or information about Graham Nelson or interactive fiction in this room. I will try to go back to the lobby and explore other areas of the library.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go south]

Observation:
Maybe you should go out through the doors to the southeast.

The technician pulls out a piece of wire and adds it to the collection.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that I cannot go south from my current location. The game is suggesting that I go out through the doors to the southeast. I will follow this suggestion and see where it leads me.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go out through the doors to the southeast]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that there are no doors to the southeast from my current location. I will try to go back to the lobby and explore other areas of the library.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation:
Maybe you should go out through the doors to the southeast.

The repairman yelps as he touches the wrong wire, and with an ear-splitting *POP*, vanishes in a cloud of greasy smoke...

Looks like there's no chance of getting a copy made now.....

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that I cannot go out through the doors to the southeast from my current location. The repairman has also vanished in a cloud of smoke, which suggests that there may be some danger in this area. I will avoid this area and try to go back to the lobby and explore other areas of the library.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation: Maybe you should go out through the doors to the southeast.

Reflect: Reflection: I have now tried to go out through the doors to the southeast several times, but it seems that this is not a valid action. I am not sure why the game is suggesting this action, as it does not appear to be possible. I have also encountered a dangerous situation with the repairman, which suggests that I need to be careful and avoid any potential dangers. I will try to go back to the lobby and explore other areas of the library.

Thought: I will try to go north to the Private room and see if I can find the book there.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation: Maybe you should go out through the doors to the southeast.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that I cannot go north from my current location. The game is still suggesting that I go out through the doors to the southeast, which is not a valid action. I am not sure why I am unable to go north, but I will try to find another way to reach the Private room.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look for another way to reach the Private room]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that the game's parser is not recognizing my input as a valid command. I need to find a way to rephrase my command in a way that the game can understand.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Check for another way to reach the Private room]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that there is no other way to reach the Private room from my current location. I have tried several different ways of asking the game to find another way to reach the Private room, but none of them have been successful. At this point, I am not sure how to proceed. I could try asking for help in a more general way, or I could try exploring other areas of the library. However, I am concerned that I may not be able to find the book I need in this library.
