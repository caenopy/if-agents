You've given your Company a weekend pass to get some R&R after your last grueling mission.  Wasting precious little time your entire company took off for the city proper to pack in as much drinking, carousing, brawling, wenching and other relaxing pursuits as possible in 48 hours.  In the fields of battle your men are an elite unit of trained professionals.  Off-duty they're pretty much like every other bunch of soldiers you've ever served with. \n\nA weekend off and what to do? After the challenges of the past year when you were first promoted and assumed command of Charlie Company you've nearly forgotton what free time is and what you're supposed to do with it.\n\nPentari\nAn Interactive Prequel To First Light \nCopyright 1998 (C) Howard A.

In case you're not here are some guidelines for playing:\n\n1) Don't look for any graphics.  This is interactive fiction.  Fine books\ndon't have pictures to accompany the text and neither does this game.\nRead the screen carefully.  It will contain a description of where\nyou are, items which may (or may not) be of use to you and in most\ncases the other directions you can go which lead to other parts of\nthe game.\n\n2) Try to keep it simple.  You don't have to, but try.  This game is\nwritten in Inform by Graham Nelson.  It is quite sophisticated to \nrecognize anything reasonable which may, in some form or fashion,\nhave relevance to the game.\n\n3) Save your game often! You'll probably goof somewhere along the way\nand saving your game will allow you to restore back to your previous\nposition.  If you don't save your games with some degree of frequency\nyou run the risk of having to start all over again from the beginning.\n\n4) Some commands you should be aware of:\n\nsave - Save or 'bookmark' your position in the game at the time of saving. \n\nrestore - Load in the last game saved or resume where you are bookmarked. \n\nrestart - Will restart your game from the beginning. \n\nquit - Abbreviated as q.  Will quit the game when you say so. \n\nundo - If you goofed somewhere, this will undo your last turn. \n\nscore - Shows your progress in the game so far. \n\nn,s,e,w - The 4 primary directions.  these will navigate you through\nthe game.  In addition, ne, se, sw, nw, up, down, in or out\nare also good to remember.\n\nagain - Abbreviated as g.  This will repeat the last command entered. \n\nexamine - Abbreviated as x.  This is useful to take a closer look\nat something such as: EXAMINE THE SCROLL \n\nlook - Will give you a description of the room you are currently in. \n\ntake <it",

        "observation": "Welcome to Pentari!\n\nIf you've ever played an adventure game before then you should be right\nat home here.  In case you're not here are some guidelines for playing:\n\n1) Don't look for any graphics.  This is interactive fiction.  Fine books\ndon't have pictures to accompany the text and neither does this game.\nRead the screen carefully.  It will contain a description of where\nyou are, items which may (or may not) be of use to you and in most\ncases the other directions you can go which lead to other parts of\nthe game.\n\n2) Try to keep it simple.  You don't have to, but try.  This game is\nwritten in Inform by Graham Nelson.  It is quite sophisticated to \nrecognize anything reasonable which may, in some form or fashion,\nhave relevance to the game.\n\n3) Save your game often! You'll probably goof somewhere along the way\nand saving your game will allow you to restore back to your previous\nposition.  If you don't save your games with some degree of frequency\nyou run the risk of having to start all over again from the beginning.\n\n4) Some commands you should be aware of:\n\nsave - Save or 'bookmark' your position in the game at the time of saving. \n\nrestore - Load in the last game saved or resume where you are bookmarked. \n\nrestart - Will restart your game from the beginning. \n\nquit - Abbreviated as q.  Will quit the game when you say so. \n\nundo - If you goofed somewhere, this will undo your last turn. \n\nscore - Shows your progress in the game so far. \n\nn,s,e,w - The 4 primary directions.  these will navigate you through\nthe game.  In addition, ne, se, sw, nw, up, down, in or out\nare also good to remember.\n\nagain - Abbreviated as g.  This will repeat the last command entered. \n\nexamine - Abbreviated as x.  This is useful to take a closer look\nat something such as: EXAMINE THE SCROLL \n\nlook - Will give you a description of the room you are currently in. \n\ntake <it",

        "observation": "Welcome to Pentari!\n\nIf you've ever played an adventure game before then you should be right\nat home here.  In case you're not here are some guidelines for playing:\n\n1) Don't look for any graphics.  This is interactive fiction.  Fine books\ndon't have pictures to accompany the text and neither does this game.\nRead the screen carefully.  It will contain a description of where\nyou are, items which may (or may not) be of use to you and in most\ncases the other directions you can go which lead to other parts of\nthe game.\n\n2) Try to keep it simple.  You don't have to, but try.  This game is\nwritten in Inform by Graham Nelson.  It is quite sophisticated to \nrecognize anything reasonable which may, in some form or fashion,\nhave relevance to the game.\n\n3) Save your game often! You'll probably goof somewhere along the way\nand saving your game will allow you to restore back to your previous\nposition.  If you don't save your games with some degree of frequency\nyou run the risk of having to start all over again from the beginning.\n\n4) Some commands you should be aware of:\n\nsave - Save or 'bookmark' your position in the game at the time of saving. \n\nrestore - Load in the last game saved or resume where you are bookmarked. \n\nrestart - Will restart your game from the beginning. \n\nquit - Abbreviated as q.  Will quit the game when you say so. \n\nundo - If you goofed somewhere, this will undo your last turn. \n\nscore - Shows your progress in the game so far. \n\nn,s,e,w - The 4 primary directions.  these will navigate you through\nthe game.  In addition, ne, se, sw, nw, up, down, in or out\nare also good to remember.\n\nagain - Abbreviated as g.  This will repeat the last command entered. \n\nexamine - Abbreviated as x.  This is useful to take a closer look\nat something such as: EXAMINE THE SCROLL \n\nlook - Will give you a description of the room you are currently in. \n\ntake <it",

It's nothing more than a three sided booth\npre-programmed to a single destination.  A sign directly over the booth bears the simple legend 'City Transporter' over it.",
