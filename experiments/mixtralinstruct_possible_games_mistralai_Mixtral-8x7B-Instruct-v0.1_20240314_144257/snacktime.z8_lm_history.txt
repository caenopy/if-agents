You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Follow the following format.

Observation: observations based on action

Reflect: self reflection on your progress and strategy taken thus far

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'] or, when done, Finish[answer]

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
<RRROWWGRROWL> Your stomach growls.

You've been vegging out in front of that flickering screen for hours, your pet by your side. Now your complaining stomach sets you up on your feet, and on a mission.

Sitting Room
This is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food. That is a good room.

Even though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of "no"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.

Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am in a sitting room with a sleeping pet and there is a room to the west that contains food. My stomach is growling, indicating that I should go to the room with the food to get something to eat.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go West]

Observation:
Food Room
Food room, glorious food room!

Your bowl for food and water is here, but that's only the beginning. There's also a lot of secret places where your pet keeps food and things that go with food and things that make food better. There's a thing that gets hot and a box that stays cold, and that is your favorite because you know there is always food inside there. A cloth hangs down from the door of the cold box.

Thought: Based on the observation, I have entered the food room and there are several objects here that could potentially be food or related to food. I should examine these objects more closely to determine what I can eat.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine bowl]

Observation: Your bowl has two sides, one for food and one for water. Right now both spots are empty.

Thought: Based on the observation, my bowl is currently empty and I cannot eat or drink from it. I should examine the other objects in the room to see if they contain any food.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine hot thing]

Observation: It's not always hot, but you've learned to stay away from it just in case it is.

Reflect: Reflection: After examining the hot thing and determining that it is not a source of food, I will continue to examine the other objects in the room. I will also keep in mind that I need to find food to satisfy my hunger.

Thought: Based on the observation, the hot thing is not a source of food. I should examine the cold box next, as it is my favorite and there is usually food inside.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine cold box]

Observation:
The cold box hums softly. It must be happy because it has a lot of food inside it. That always makes you happy.

Right now the door is closed, so you can't see the food inside. But you know it's there. A cloth hangs down from the door right at your nose level.

Thought: Based on the observation, the cold box contains food and is currently closed. I should open the cold box to access the food.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Open cold box]

Observation:
This is a good trick!

You pull on the cloth with your teeth and back up as the door opens. Inside you can see various leftovers, some jars, some sandwich fixings and one shiny can.

Thought: Based on the observation, I can see various leftovers, jars, sandwich fixings, and a shiny can inside the cold box. I should examine these items more closely to determine which one would be the best to eat and satisfy my hunger.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine shiny can]

Observation: It's shiny and filled with some liquid that your pet really likes.

Thought: Based on the observation, the shiny can contains a liquid that my pet really likes. It's possible that this liquid could be something that I would also enjoy, as pets often have similar tastes to their owners. I should open the can and see what is inside.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Open can]

Observation: Just one more thing you can't do with paws. Too bad you live in a world made for creatures with hands.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am unable to open the can because I don't have hands. I will need to find a way to open the can using the resources available to me in the room.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine other objects in the room]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Reflect: Reflection: After examining the other objects in the room and not finding anything that can help me open the can, I will consider other options. I could try to find a tool or object that can help me open the can, or I could try to find an alternative source of food in the room. I will also keep in mind that I need to find a way to open the can and access the liquid inside, as it may be able to satisfy my hunger.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am unable to find a tool or object in the room that can help me open the can.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine other objects in the room]
