What was that?

You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.

"No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind."

After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.

Rickety Fence
The ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other. Although it hasn't fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and if that egg isn't careful...

The footpath running along the fence veers sharply north.

The egg hums a little tune your mother used to sing at bedtime.
> Ask egg how I can help
To talk to egg, try one of the following techniques:

     egg, do something
     ask egg about topic
     tell egg about topic
> Ask egg how I can help
To talk to egg, try one of the following techniques:

     egg, do something
     ask egg about topic
     tell egg about topic
> Tell egg about the grove of trees to the north
"I can't do much about that," shrugs the egg.
> Ask egg about the grove of trees to the north
"Do take care," warns the egg. "It's very dark in there, and all the king's horses and men--pardon me, I meant troops--can't patrol it as often as they should. Decent lighting and video cameras would help, of course, but budgets are tight these days."
> Go north
Bravely, the egg calls after you: "My life is in your hands! I trust you will return shortly to rescue me!"

Forest
The sun has disappeared. Only a narrow north-south passage winds through the forest here; trees and gnarled undergrowth barricade all other exits. Chill air seeps up from the ground and coils around your body, reaching down your neck with insistent, clammy fingers.
> Look around for useful items
You can't see any such thing.
> Go north
Deep Forest
Wet branches slap your face, their icy needles stinging. Dense underbrush creeps in from all sides. With each step, mud oozes into your shoes. Insects drop from above and crawl through your hair; knuckles scrape against rough bark. The path hooks from south to southwest here, slithering between the trees like a snake. Faint rustling sounds catch your ear, but when you turn to look, all is still and quiet.

At your feet, a green and yellow basket lies on its side. Whoever dropped it must have been in a hurry, because the contents have spilled out and are strewn everywhere.

An iron pot has come to rest at the edge of the footpath, near a tree.

You can also see a cracked porcelain dish and a bent spoon here.
> Pick up the iron pot
Taken.

The whispery rustling grows louder.
> Look around for more useful items
You can't see any such thing.
> Check the green and yellow basket
Woven from green and yellow straw, the picnic basket has seen better days. One corner is dented, and the straw is ripped where a handle was once attached. The picnic basket is empty.

You glance around nervously. The rustling seems very close now.
> Look around for potential dangers
You can't see any such thing.
> Go southwest
Country Lane
The footpath snaking down from the northeastern forest has widened here into a country lane. Gravel crunches beneath your feet and a warm breeze riffles your hair as you walk in the sun. Some distance to the west, a few small cottages flock together like children telling secrets. Smoke curls from the chimney of the cottage nearest to you. Beyond the village, further west, a clock tower rises above the surrounding roofs.
> Explore the small cottages
That's not a verb I recognise.
> Go west towards the small cottages
I only understood you as far as wanting to go the west wall.
> Go west towards the west wall
I only understood you as far as wanting to go the west wall.
> Walk a few steps to the west
You can't see any such thing.
> Examine the west wall
You see nothing special about the west wall.
> Go around the west wall to the south
You can't see any such thing.
> Walk a few steps to the south
You can't see any such thing.
> Go northeast

> Go back the way I came

> Go south
Forest
> Go south
Rickety Fence

The egg flicks an invisible piece of lint off his shirt.
> Go west
You trudge along, trees to your right, fence to your left. After a little while, you sit down to rest. The fence and the road look the same here; nothing has changed, except that now you're completely alone on a road to nowhere. Discouraged, you stand up and trudge all the way back to the egg.
> Go north
"Leaving so soon?" sighs the egg. "Well, be careful. Dangerous creatures lurk in the shadows."

> Examine the iron pot
The pot is deep and flat-bottomed, with a curved handle that crosses from one side to the other for easy carrying. Although the iron pot has started to rust, you can see where something has dribbled out from under the lid and run down the sides.
> Open the iron pot
The lid and pot are so firmly attached to each other that you must tug with all your strength to separate them. All at once, without warning, the seal between them gives way. The lid flies out of your grasp and rolls out of sight.

Fortunately, you still have the pot. In it, you see some pease porridge.
> Eat the pease porridge
Really! Were you born in a barn? You can almost hear your mother's voice: "Civilised people do not stick their faces in a pot to eat."
> Pour the pease porridge into the cracked porcelain dish
You can't see any such thing.
