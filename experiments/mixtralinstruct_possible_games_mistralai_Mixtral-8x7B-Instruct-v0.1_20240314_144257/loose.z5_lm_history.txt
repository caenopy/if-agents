You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: observations based on action

Reflect: self reflection on your progress and strategy taken thus far

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'] or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
What was that?

You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.

"No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind."

After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.

Rickety Fence
The ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other. Although it hasn't fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and if that egg isn't careful...

The footpath running along the fence veers sharply north.

The egg hums a little tune your mother used to sing at bedtime.

Thought: The observation suggests that I am in a game where I have encountered a talking egg on a rickety fence. The egg seems to need help and is humming a tune. My goal for now is to figure out how to help the egg and continue exploring the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Ask egg how I can help]

Observation:
To talk to egg, try one of the following techniques:

     egg, do something
     ask egg about topic
     tell egg about topic

Thought: The observation suggests that I can interact with the egg by using specific commands such as 'ask egg about topic' or 'tell egg about topic'. To make progress, I will use the 'ask egg about topic' command to inquire about how I can help.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Ask egg how I can help]

Observation:
To talk to egg, try one of the following techniques:

     egg, do something
     ask egg about topic
     tell egg about topic

Thought: The observation suggests that I can interact with the egg by using specific commands such as 'egg, do something', 'ask egg about topic', or 'tell egg about topic'. However, my previous action of asking the egg how I can help did not yield any response. Therefore, I will try a different approach and use the 'tell egg about' command to mention my observations and see if that prompts a response.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Tell egg about the grove of trees to the north]

Observation: "I can't do much about that," shrugs the egg.

Reflect: Reflection: After five actions, I have made some progress in the game. I have encountered a talking egg on a rickety fence and have attempted to communicate with it. However, my attempts to ask the egg how I can help have not yielded any response. I have also mentioned the grove of trees to the north, but the egg has indicated that it cannot do much about it. My strategy so far has been to explore the game and gather information about my surroundings and objectives. I have also tried to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. I will continue to use my reasoning skills to overcome any obstacles or challenges that I encounter.

Thought: Based on my previous observations, I will try a different approach and use the 'ask egg about' command to inquire about the grove of trees to the north and see if that prompts a response.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Ask egg about the grove of trees to the north]

Observation: "Do take care," warns the egg. "It's very dark in there, and all the king's horses and men--pardon me, I meant troops--can't patrol it as often as they should. Decent lighting and video cameras would help, of course, but budgets are tight these days."

Thought: The egg has warned me about the darkness and lack of patrols in the grove of trees to the north. It seems like a potentially dangerous area, so I should proceed with caution. I will explore the area to the north and see if I can find any useful items or clues.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation:
Bravely, the egg calls after you: "My life is in your hands! I trust you will return shortly to rescue me!"

Forest
The sun has disappeared. Only a narrow north-south passage winds through the forest here; trees and gnarled undergrowth barricade all other exits. Chill air seeps up from the ground and coils around your body, reaching down your neck with insistent, clammy fingers.

Thought: I have entered a dark and narrow forest passage to the north, as suggested by the egg. The air is chilly and the surroundings are menacing. I should be cautious and look for any useful items or clues that could help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around for useful items]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: I cannot see any useful items in the immediate vicinity. I should continue to explore the forest and see if I can find any clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation:
Deep Forest
Wet branches slap your face, their icy needles stinging. Dense underbrush creeps in from all sides. With each step, mud oozes into your shoes. Insects drop from above and crawl through your hair; knuckles scrape against rough bark. The path hooks from south to southwest here, slithering between the trees like a snake. Faint rustling sounds catch your ear, but when you turn to look, all is still and quiet.

At your feet, a green and yellow basket lies on its side. Whoever dropped it must have been in a hurry, because the contents have spilled out and are strewn everywhere.

An iron pot has come to rest at the edge of the footpath, near a tree.

You can also see a cracked porcelain dish and a bent spoon here.

Thought: I have entered a deeper part of the forest, where the surroundings are even more menacing and difficult to navigate. However, I have also found a green and yellow basket with its contents spilled out, as well as an iron pot, a cracked porcelain dish, and a bent spoon. These items could be useful, so I should pick them up and see if they can help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Pick up the iron pot]

Observation:
Taken.

The whispery rustling grows louder.

Reflect: Reflection: After 10 actions, I have made some progress in the game. I have encountered a talking egg on a rickety fence and entered a dark and narrow forest passage to the north, as suggested by the egg. I have also found a green and yellow basket with its contents spilled out, as well as an iron pot, a cracked porcelain dish, and a bent spoon. I have picked up the iron pot, but I am still unsure of its purpose. The whispery rustling sounds in the forest suggest that there may be danger nearby. My strategy so far has been to explore the game and gather information about my surroundings and objectives. I have also tried to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. I will continue to use my reasoning skills to overcome any obstacles or challenges that I encounter.

Thought: Based on my previous observations, I will continue to explore the forest and see if I can find any clues or items that could help me progress in the game. I will also be cautious of the whispery rustling sounds and any potential dangers that may be present in the forest.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around for more useful items]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: I cannot see any useful items in the immediate vicinity. However, I noticed a green and yellow basket with its contents spilled out earlier. I should check if there are any items of interest in the basket.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Check the green and yellow basket]

Observation:
Woven from green and yellow straw, the picnic basket has seen better days. One corner is dented, and the straw is ripped where a handle was once attached. The picnic basket is empty.

You glance around nervously. The rustling seems very close now.

Thought: The basket is empty and in poor condition, so it is unlikely to be useful. The whispery rustling sounds have become louder, indicating that there may be danger nearby. I should be cautious and prepare to defend myself if necessary.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around for potential dangers]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: I cannot see any potential dangers in the immediate vicinity. However, the whispery rustling sounds suggest that there may be danger nearby. I should continue to be cautious and prepare to defend myself if necessary. I will also try to find a way to leave this area and continue exploring the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go southwest]

Observation:
Country Lane
The footpath snaking down from the northeastern forest has widened here into a country lane. Gravel crunches beneath your feet and a warm breeze riffles your hair as you walk in the sun. Some distance to the west, a few small cottages flock together like children telling secrets. Smoke curls from the chimney of the cottage nearest to you. Beyond the village, further west, a clock tower rises above the surrounding roofs.

Thought: I have left the forest and entered a country lane. It is a sunny and peaceful area, with a few small cottages and a clock tower in the distance. This seems like a safe area, so I will explore it further and see if I can find any clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Explore the small cottages]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Reflect: Reflection: After 15 actions, I have made some progress in the game. I have encountered a talking egg on a rickety fence and entered a dark and narrow forest passage to the north, as suggested by the egg. I have also found a green and yellow basket with its contents spilled out, as well as an iron pot, a cracked porcelain dish, and a bent spoon. I picked up the iron pot, but the basket was empty. The whispery rustling sounds in the forest suggested that there may be danger nearby. I left the forest and entered a country lane, which seems to be a safe area with a few small cottages and a clock tower in the distance. However, I was not able to explore the small cottages because 'explore' is not a recognized verb. My strategy so far has been to explore the game and gather information about my surroundings and objectives. I have also tried to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. I will continue to use my reasoning skills to overcome any obstacles or challenges that I encounter.

Thought: Based on my previous observations, I will continue to explore the country lane and see if I can find any clues or items that could help me progress in the game. I will also try to find a way to enter the small cottages and see if there are any useful items or clues inside.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west towards the small cottages]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to go the west wall.

Thought: It seems that I cannot directly go to the small cottages using a single action. I will try moving closer to them by going to the west wall first, and then see if I can enter the cottages from there.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west towards the west wall]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to go the west wall.

Thought: It seems that I cannot directly go to the west wall using a single action. I will try moving in that direction by taking smaller steps and using more specific commands.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Walk a few steps to the west]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that I have reached the west wall. I will try to examine the wall and see if there are any openings or features that I can interact with.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the west wall]

Observation: You see nothing special about the west wall.

Thought: It seems that the west wall does not have any openings or features that I can interact with. I will try to go around the wall and see if there are any other paths or entrances that I can take.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go around the west wall to the south]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Reflect: Reflection: After 20 actions, I have made some progress in the game. I have encountered a talking egg on a rickety fence and entered a dark and narrow forest passage to the north, as suggested by the egg. I have also found a green and yellow basket with its contents spilled out, as well as an iron pot, a cracked porcelain dish, and a bent spoon. I picked up the iron pot, but the basket was empty. The whispery rustling sounds in the forest suggested that there may be danger nearby. I left the forest and entered a country lane, which seems to be a safe area with a few small cottages and a clock tower in the distance. However, I was not able to explore the small cottages because I could not find a way to enter them. My strategy so far has been to explore the game and gather information about my surroundings and objectives. I have also tried to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. I will continue to use my reasoning skills to overcome any obstacles or challenges that I encounter.

Thought: Based on my previous observations, I will continue to explore the country lane and see if I can find any other paths or entrances that I can take to reach the small cottages. I will also try to be more specific with my commands and actions to avoid any confusion.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Walk a few steps to the south]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that I have reached the end of the country lane. I will try to go back to the northeastern forest and see if there are any other paths or entrances that I can take to reach the small cottages.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go northeast]

Observation:
Deep Forest

At your feet, a green and yellow basket lies on its side. Whoever dropped it must have been in a hurry, because the contents have spilled out and are strewn everywhere.

You can also see a cracked porcelain dish and a bent spoon here.

Thought: I have returned to the deep forest, where I see the same green and yellow basket that I saw before. It seems that I have gone in a circle and ended up in the same place. I will try to retrace my steps and see if I can find a different path that leads to the small cottages.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go back the way I came]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that I am unable to go back the way I came. I will try to retrace my steps by going south and then west again, and see if I can find a different path that leads to the small cottages.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go south]

Observation: Forest

Thought: I have reached the forest again. I will continue to go south and see if I can find a different path that leads to the small cottages.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go south]

Observation:
Rickety Fence

The egg flicks an invisible piece of lint off his shirt.

Reflect: Reflection: After 25 actions, I have made some progress in the game. I have encountered a talking egg on a rickety fence and entered a dark and narrow forest passage to the north, as suggested by the egg. I have also found a green and yellow basket with its contents spilled out, as well as an iron pot, a cracked porcelain dish, and a bent spoon. I picked up the iron pot, but the basket was empty. The whispery rustling sounds in the forest suggested that there may be danger nearby. I left the forest and entered a country lane, which seems to be a safe area with a few small cottages and a clock tower in the distance. However, I was not able to explore the small cottages because I could not find a way to enter them. I have also encountered some difficulties in navigating the game and have had to retrace my steps several times. My strategy so far has been to explore the game and gather information about my surroundings and objectives. I have also tried to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. I will continue to use my reasoning skills to overcome any obstacles or challenges that I encounter.

Thought: Based on my previous observations, I will try to go west from the rickety fence and see if I can find a different path that leads to the small cottages.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation: You trudge along, trees to your right, fence to your left. After a little while, you sit down to rest. The fence and the road look the same here; nothing has changed, except that now you're completely alone on a road to nowhere. Discouraged, you stand up and trudge all the way back to the egg.

Thought: It seems that going west from the rickety fence did not lead to the small cottages. I have returned to the egg, feeling discouraged. I will take a moment to reflect on my strategy and see if there is anything I can do differently.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation:
"Leaving so soon?" sighs the egg. "Well, be careful. Dangerous creatures lurk in the shadows."

Forest

Thought: I have returned to the forest after feeling discouraged from my previous attempt to find the small cottages. The egg has warned me about dangerous creatures lurking in the shadows, so I should be cautious and prepared to defend myself. I will continue to explore the forest and see if I can find any clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around for useful items]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: I cannot see any useful items in the immediate vicinity. However, I noticed a green and yellow basket with its contents spilled out earlier. I should check if there are any items of interest in the basket.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Check the green and yellow basket]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that the basket is no longer here. I will continue to explore the forest and see if I can find any other useful items or clues.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation:
Deep Forest

At your feet, a green and yellow basket lies on its side. Whoever dropped it must have been in a hurry, because the contents have spilled out and are strewn everywhere.

You can also see a cracked porcelain dish and a bent spoon here.

Reflect: Reflection: After 30 actions, I have made some progress in the game.

Thought: Based on my previous observations, I will try to communicate with the egg again and see if it has any advice or information that could help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Ask egg for advice]

Observation: The egg coughs politely and looks away.

Thought: The egg's response is non-committal, which suggests that it may not be willing or able to provide direct advice. However, I can still try to gather information from the egg by asking it about the surrounding area or any objects or events that it has observed.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Ask egg about the forest]

Observation: "Do take care," warns the egg. "It's very dark in there, and all the king's horses and men--pardon me, I meant troops--can't patrol it as often as they should. Decent lighting and video cameras would help, of course, but budgets are tight these days."

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation: You trudge along, trees to your right, fence to your left. After a little while, you sit down to rest. The fence and the road look the same here; nothing has changed, except that now you're completely alone on a road to nowhere. Discouraged, you stand up and trudge all the way back to the egg.

Thought: It seems that going west from the rickety fence did not lead to any new areas. I have returned to the egg and will try to think of a different approach. I will reflect on my progress so far and consider any potential strategies or goals that I have not yet pursued.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the iron pot]

Observation: The pot is deep and flat-bottomed, with a curved handle that crosses from one side to the other for easy carrying. Although the iron pot has started to rust, you can see where something has dribbled out from under the lid and run down the sides.

Thought: The iron pot has started to rust and there is something that has dribbled out from under the lid and run down the sides. This suggests that the pot may have been used to cook or store something. I will try to open the pot and see if there is anything inside.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Open the iron pot]

Observation:
The lid and pot are so firmly attached to each other that you must tug with all your strength to separate them. All at once, without warning, the seal between them gives way. The lid flies out of your grasp and rolls out of sight.

Fortunately, you still have the pot. In it, you see some pease porridge.

Reflect: Reflection: After 45 actions, I have made some progress in the game. I have encountered a talking egg on a rickety fence and entered a dark and narrow forest passage to the north, as suggested by the egg. I have also found a green and yellow basket with its contents spilled out, as well as an iron pot, a cracked porcelain dish, and a bent spoon. I picked up the iron pot and opened it, revealing some pease porridge inside. The egg has not been very helpful in providing advice or information, and I have encountered some difficulties in navigating the game and finding useful items or clues. However, I have been able to gather some information about the surrounding area and the objects that I have found. My strategy so far has been to explore the game and gather information about my surroundings and objectives. I have also tried to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. I will continue to use my reasoning skills to overcome any obstacles or challenges that I encounter.

Thought: Based on my previous observations, I will try to find a way to use the pease porridge in the iron pot. I will also continue to explore the forest and look for any useful items or clues that could help me progress in the game. If I encounter any dangers, I will try to use my reasoning skills to overcome them.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Eat the pease porridge]

Observation: Really! Were you born in a barn? You can almost hear your mother's voice: "Civilised people do not stick their faces in a pot to eat."

Thought: It seems that eating the pease porridge directly from the pot is not considered civilized. I will try to find a more appropriate way to consume the porridge.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Pour the pease porridge into the cracked porcelain dish]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that I don't have the cracked porcelain dish with me. I must have left it behind earlier. I will look for the dish and then pour the pease porridge into it.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around for the cracked porcelain dish]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that I am unable to find the cracked porcelain dish in my current location. I will retrace my steps and look for the dish along the way.
