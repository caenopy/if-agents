You remember darkness. And the cold. Cold and darkness. And silence. Those memories are all that you have. That, and a feeling that something you never knew you possessed has been lost.

Suddenly, oblivion is split by a blinding light and a crash of sound. You awaken to the roar of a storm and a deluge of rain and mud.

In the Mud
Rain and muddy water are pouring down on you, making it difficult to see or even breathe. Sodden earth and mud surrounds you on all sides except overhead, where flashes of lightning illuminate a storm tossed sky.
> look around
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> examine
(yourself)
You find you cannot look down at yourself. It is almost as if you know what you might find and are afraid to have your fears confirmed.
> examine surroundings
You can't see any such thing.
> examine mud
The sides of the hole are made of dark, rich earth, now soaked through by the torrential downpour.  As you watch, more and more mud is washed away and into the hole with you.
> examine hole
You can't see any such thing.
> go up
As you scramble out of the hole the mud collapses downward, filling in the hole behind you.

Graveyard
Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The only exit is through the gate to the east.

A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the graveyard.

A large branch has been broken from one of the trees and has crushed the grave marker below it.
> examine fence
You can't see any such thing.
> examine tree
These ancient, twisted trees surround and even invade the graveyard. Now tossed wildly by the storm, their branches reach skyward while their roots suck unholy nourishment from between the broken slabs.
> examine church
The old church has seen better days. Formerly painted white, the boards are now faded, peeling and rotted. Most of the windows are boarded up, and those that aren't have long since been broken out. The shingles have fallen from the roof, which sags alarmingly. A broken-tipped steeple rises from one end of the building, and a faint miasma of decay seems to rise from the structure.

Lightning arcs overhead, followed instantly by a blast of thunder.
> examine boards
Once, the windows were probably told stories of hope and redemption in brightly colored stained glass. Now, they are boarded up as if the church has closed it's eyes to the world outside.
> examine grave marker
The marker for this grave has been shattered by the fall of a large branch from the overhanging tree. The grave itself has been disturbed; the soil has fallen in to form a shallow pit.
