You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: observations based on action

Reflect: self reflection on your progress and strategy taken thus far

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'] or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
GREAT.  THEY'VE DONE IT TO ME AGAIN.  You think to yourself. THEY'VE STUCK ME IN ANOTHER ONE OF THEIR SILLY SCENARIOS.  You glance about with a look of irritation on your face.  WELL, I'LL SHOW THEM.  I'LL MAKE SHORT WORK OF THEIR STUPID LITTLE PUZZLE...

Court Yard
A good sized courtyard with an air of late British colonialism about it.  To the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall with an ornate iron gate set into the rock.  The walls of a large stone mansion rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south.  In the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window.  On top of the west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of sticks, twigs, and leaves.

A carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net.  In one corner of the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light.  The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green.  Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone.

A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine.

The tennis ball launching machine sitting in one corner of the yard looks like a relic from the 1930s.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am in a courtyard with a high stone wall to the west, a large stone mansion to the east, north, and south, and a tennis court with an oak tree and a well in the corner. There is also a rusty tin pail and an old tennis ball launching machine in the yard. My goal is likely to escape the courtyard, and I can use the tin pail to collect acorns from the tree. I will start by going to the oak tree and collecting acorns with the tin pail.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go to the oak tree]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that the game doesn't recognize my command to go to the oak tree. I will try to be more specific and use a compass direction to move closer to the tree.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation: You can't go that way.

Thought: It seems that I cannot go east for some reason. I will try moving in a different direction to get closer to the oak tree.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation: You can't go that way.

Reflect: Reflection: I have tried moving in different directions, but I am unable to go east or west. I will try moving north or south to see if I can get closer to the oak tree. I will also pay closer attention to the descriptions of my movements and surroundings to look for any clues or obstacles that might be preventing me from moving in certain directions.

Thought: I will try moving north to see if I can get closer to the oak tree.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation: You can't go that way.

Thought: It seems that I cannot go north either. I will try moving south and see if that brings me closer to the oak tree.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go south]

Observation: You can't go that way.

Thought: It seems that I am unable to move in any direction. This is unusual and unexpected. I will try to examine my surroundings more closely to see if there is any information that can help me understand why I am unable to move.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine surroundings]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that the game does not recognize my command to examine my surroundings. This is unexpected and unusual. I will try to use a more specific command to examine my surroundings and see if that yields any useful information.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the courtyard]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that the game does not recognize my command to examine the courtyard. This is unexpected and unusual. I will try to use the most specific command possible to examine my surroundings and see if that yields any useful information.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the area around me]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Reflect: Reflection: I have tried several different commands to examine my surroundings and move around the courtyard, but none of them have been successful. This is unusual and unexpected. I will try to think creatively and use more unconventional commands to see if I can make any progress. I will also pay close attention to any error messages or feedback that the game provides, as this might give me a clue about what I am doing wrong.

Thought: I will try using a more descriptive command to examine my surroundings and see if that yields any useful information.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought: It seems that the game is only recognizing part of my command. I will try to use a simpler command and see if that is more successful.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look]

Observation:
Court Yard
A good sized courtyard with an air of late British colonialism about it.  To the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall with an ornate iron gate set into the rock.  The walls of a large stone mansion rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south.  In the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window.  On top of the west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of sticks, twigs, and leaves.

A carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net.  In one corner of the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light.  The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green.  Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone.

A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine.

The tennis ball launching machine sitting in one corner of the yard looks like a relic from the 1930s.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am still in the same location in the courtyard. I am unable to move or examine my surroundings using the usual commands. I will try using a more unconventional command to see if I can make any progress.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Shout for help]

Observation:
(to yourself)
There is no reply.

Thought: It seems that there is no one around to hear my shout for help. I am still unable to move or examine my surroundings using the usual commands. I will try using a different unconventional command to see if I can make any progress.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Try to climb the tree]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought: It seems that the game does not recognize "try" as a verb. I will try using a more direct command to climb the tree.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Climb the tree]

Observation: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

Reflect: Reflection: I have tried a variety of commands to move, examine my surroundings, and interact with the tree, but none of them have been successful. I am still unable to make any progress in the game. I will try using even more unconventional commands to see if I can find a way to make progress. I will also pay close attention to any error messages or feedback that the game provides, as this might give me a clue about what I am doing wrong.

Thought: I will try using a more descriptive command to climb the tree and see if that yields any useful information.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Climb up the tree]

Observation: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

Thought: It seems that I am unable to climb the tree using the usual commands. This is unusual and unexpected. I will try using a more unconventional command to see if I can make any progress.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Attempt to climb the tree]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought: It seems that the game does not recognize "attempt" as a verb. I will try using a different verb to climb the tree.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Try to ascend the tree]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought: It seems that the game does not recognize "ascend" as a verb. I will try using a different verb to climb the tree.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Scale the tree]

Observation: I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

Thought: It seems that I am unable to climb the tree using the usual or unconventional commands. This is unusual and unexpected. I will try using a different approach to make progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the tennis ball launching machine]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Reflect: Reflection: I have tried a variety of commands to move, examine my surroundings, and interact with the tree and the tennis ball launching machine, but none of them have been successful. I am still unable to make any progress in the game. I will try using even more unconventional commands and approaches to see if I can find a way to make progress. I will also pay close attention to any error messages or feedback that the game provides, as this might give me a clue about what I am doing wrong.

Thought: I will try using a more descriptive command to examine the tennis ball launching machine and see if that yields any useful information.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the old tennis ball launching machine]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that the game does not recognize my command to examine the tennis ball launching machine. This is unexpected and unusual. I will try using the most specific command possible to examine the machine and see if that yields any useful information.

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that I am unable to examine the tennis ball launching machine using the usual or unconventional commands. This is unusual and unexpected. I will try using a different approach to make progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look at the ground]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It's strange that I can't seem to interact with any objects or move around in the game. I will try to reset the game and start again, in case there was an issue with the initial setup. If that doesn't work, I will try using even more unconventional commands and approaches to see if I can find a way to make progress. I will also pay close attention to any error messages or feedback that the game provides, as this might give me a clue about what I am doing wrong.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Restart]

Observation: Are you sure you want to restart?                                                                                                                                 Court YardScore: 0Moves: 10

Thought: Yes, I want to restart the game. I am unable to interact with any objects or move around in the game, which is unusual and unexpected. Restarting the game may fix this issue.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Yes]

Observation:

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Get the acorns]

Observation:
green acorn: Your attempts at climbing the tall, straight tree are laughable.  The acorns are far above your head and you are unable to reach them.
