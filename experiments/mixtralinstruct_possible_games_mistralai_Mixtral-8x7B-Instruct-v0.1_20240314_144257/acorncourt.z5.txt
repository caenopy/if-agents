Court Yard
A good sized courtyard with an air of late British colonialism about it.  To the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall with an ornate iron gate set into the rock.  The walls of a large stone mansion rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south.  In the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window.  On top of the west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of sticks, twigs, and leaves.

A carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net.  In one corner of the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light.  The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green.  Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone.

A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine.

The tennis ball launching machine sitting in one corner of the yard looks like a relic from the 1930s.

> Examine the tree
The tall, large oak tree casts long shadows in the evening light.  It's branches are decorated with small acorn nuts resembling little green Christmas tree ornaments.  The acorns are young and none of them have yet fallen from the tree.
> Get the acorns
green acorn: Your attempts at climbing the tall, straight tree are laughable.  The acorns are far above your head and you are unable to reach them.

A painfully detailed, ornate iron gate crafted to fit the European styling of the court yard.  The heavy, stout bars block your exit.  Upon closer inspection you find a small key hole in the border of the iron barrier.
