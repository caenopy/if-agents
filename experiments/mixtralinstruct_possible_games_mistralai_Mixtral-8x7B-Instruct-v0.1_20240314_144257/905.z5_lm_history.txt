You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: observations based on action

Reflect: self reflection on your progress and strategy taken thus far

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'] or, when done, Finish[answer]

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
The phone rings.

Oh, no - how long have you been asleep? Sure, it was a tough night, but... This is bad. This is very bad.

Bedroom (in bed)
This bedroom is extremely spare, with dirty laundry scattered haphazardly all over the floor. Cleaner clothing can be found in the dresser. A bathroom lies to the south, while a door to the east leads to the living room.

On the end table are a telephone, a wallet and some keys.

The phone rings.

Thought: The game has started and I am in a bedroom. There are a few items in the room that I can interact with, including a telephone, a wallet, and some keys. The phone is currently ringing, which suggests that there may be an urgent matter that I need to attend to. I should probably answer the phone and see what the call is about.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Answer the phone]

Observation:
You pick up the phone. "Hadley!" a shrill voice cries. "Hadley, haven't you even left yet?? You knew that our presentation was at nine o'clock sharp! First the thing with the printers, now this - there won't even be enough left of you for Bowman to fire once he's done with you. Now get the hell down here!!"

Click.

Thought: It seems that I have overslept and missed an important presentation at work. My boss is understandably upset and has instructed me to get to the office as soon as possible. I should probably get dressed and gather my belongings so that I can leave the house and head to the office.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Get dressed and gather my belongings]

Observation: [!: Noun error. (This could mean a number of things: a noun used in your command may not be present, or it may be present but not visible; it may be scenery you can't interact with; you may have specified too many indirect objects; you may have misspelled something; the list goes on.)]

Thought: It seems that I have made a mistake in my previous action and the game is unable to understand my command. I should try to be more specific and clear in my instructions to avoid any confusion.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Put on some clothes and take my wallet and keys]

Observation: [!: Noun error. (This could mean a number of things: a noun used in your command may not be present, or it may be present but not visible; it may be scenery you can't interact with; you may have specified too many indirect objects; you may have misspelled something; the list goes on.)]

Reflect: Reflection: I have encountered some difficulty in executing my intended actions in the game. It seems that I need to be more specific and clear in my instructions to avoid noun errors. I will try to pay closer attention to the wording of my actions and make sure that I am using the correct nouns and verbs. I will also try to avoid using too many indirect objects and make sure that I am not misspelling any words.

Thought: Based on my previous observations, it seems that I need to be more careful and precise in my actions. I will try to focus on interacting with the objects in the room in a clear and direct way. I will also try to prioritize my actions and make sure that I am addressing the most urgent tasks first.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Put on the clean clothes from the dresser, take my wallet and keys from the end table]

Thought: It seems that I am still encountering noun errors in my actions. I should try to be even more specific and clear in my instructions. I will make sure to specify exactly which objects I want to interact with and where they are located.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Put on the clean clothes that are in the dresser, take my wallet and keys that are on the end table]

Observation: [!: Noun error.]

Thought: It seems that I am still having trouble with noun errors. I will try to simplify my actions and focus on interacting with one object at a time. I will also make sure to double-check the spelling and placement of any nouns in my actions.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Open the dresser and take the clean clothes. Take my wallet and keys from the end table.]

Observation: [!: That verb cannot take multiple objects.]

Thought: It seems that I am still having trouble with the wording of my actions. I will try to break down my actions into smaller, more manageable steps. This should help me to avoid any errors and ensure that my actions are clear and easy to understand.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Open the dresser. Take the clean clothes. Take my wallet and keys from the end table.]

Observation:
You'll have to get out of bed first.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Get out of bed]

Observation: You get out of bed.

Reflect: Reflection: I have encountered some challenges in executing my intended actions in the game. I have had to deal with noun errors and issues with the wording of my actions. To address these challenges, I have tried to be more specific and clear in my instructions, and I have broken down my actions into smaller, more manageable steps. I have also made sure to double-check the spelling and placement of any nouns in my actions. I will continue to use these strategies as I progress through the game.

Thought: Now that I have gotten out of bed, I can interact with the dresser and the end table. I will take the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Open the dresser and take the clean clothes]' to get dressed.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Open the dresser and take the clean clothes]

Thought: It seems that the game is still having trouble understanding my command. I will try to be even more specific and clear in my instructions. I will also make sure to double-check the spelling and placement of any nouns in my actions. One possible issue is that the game is interpreting "take" as a command to pick up the clean shirt, but it is not visible or accessible. Instead, I will try to use the command "get" to retrieve the clean shirt from the dresser.

I have also made sure to double-check the spelling and placement of any nouns in my actions. However, I am still encountering noun errors and issues with the wording of my actions. I will try to think more creatively and use different verbs and phrasing to see if that helps the game understand my commands.

Thought: I will try using the verb "retrieve" to see if that helps the game understand my command. I will take the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Retrieve the clean shirt from the dresser]' to do this.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Retrieve the clean shirt from the dresser]

Observation: [!: Verb error. (This generally means that the first word of your command was not recognized.)]

Thought: It seems that the verb "retrieve" is not recognized by the game. I will try using a different verb to see if that helps. I will take the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Get the clean shirt from the dresser]' to do this.
