Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice.

Anyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new "Surfers Monthly" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening.

Shyeah, right. That's what YOU think.

Behind the Counter
You are behind the counter at "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor", where you are currently working. Not much of a job, but it keeps you from going broke during the nine months of the year when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing instructor. The rest of the parlor is southwest.

There is something pressing that you think you have to do, but you can't think what it might be.
> Look around
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> Look at the counter
It's a majorly boring counter which you're unfortunately very familiar with.  Hey, maybe that handwritten note lying next to a pizza box on the counter is related to whatever it is you're supposed to be doing now.
> Look at the note
The note reads:

"Stanley,
    Don't forget to make your delivery to Mr. Calzone, located at the San Doppleton Courthouse. You're already on thin ice, kid. One more screwup and you can expect to be looking for a new job."

The note is signed with the initials "RT". The paper is official "Mr. Tasty's" stationery with the name Bob "Tasty" Tasker and lots of balloons and smiley faces all over the border. Isn't that cute?
> Check inventory
You can't see any such thing.
> Prepare pizza
That's not a verb I recognise.
> Get pizza
Taken.
> Go southwest
You walk around to the front of the pizza parlor.

Pizza Parlor
You are standing in the middle of "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor". The counter separating you from the back of the parlor stretches in front of you on the northeast corner of the room. To the south is an exit to the street.

On the counter is a handwritten note.
> Go south
Street, by Pizza Parlor
San Doppleton is where you live, work and play -- at least until summer. It has the typical California culture; which is to say, none. But at least it's just forty minutes' drive from Santa Barbara and the beach, so you can't complain much.

You stand in the heart of San Doppleton's main drag, the business district. The street goes east and west. The sidewalk runs by a pizza parlor, with a sewer vent nearby.

A man and a woman walk by holding hands. They make a cute couple.
> Go west
Street, Near Courthouse
You are approaching the center of downtown San Doppleton. There is a courthouse to the south. The street runs east and west.
> Go south
Courthouse
You are in a crowded courthouse.  The street is off to the north.

The courtroom is currently abuzz with excitement as it seems that the pre-trial hearing of the infamous gangster, Guido "The Armadillo" Calzone is winding to a close. Guido and his hotshot lawyer sit placidly at their table, while the flustered young district attorney who is prosecuting the case seems like she's at her wits' end. At the moment, the D.A. stands at the front of the courtroom, arguing over a legal point with the judge.
> Observe
That's not a verb I recognise.
> Look around
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> Look at the courtroom
You can't see any such thing.
> Go south
You can only go north.

"Miss Thompson," says the judge, "I've had about enough of you wasting this court's time. Unless you can demonstrate a clear threat to public safety, I'm going to recommend that Mr. Calzone be transported to a minimum security prison pending further review. His trial is to be held next week."  The district attorney is clearly not happy with this pronouncement.

> Go east
Street, by Department Store
On this end of the street, a department store called Barkley's sits to the south.

You see a woman hail a taxi and drive off.

You shouldn't leaving town until you deliver that pizza. It would cost you your job, and we all know how important THAT is to you.

A big ugly low rider cruises by, blaring rap music loud enough to make the sidewalk shake.
