The Professor's map was just an ancient map -- as worthless as an ice cube in the Arctic without an instrument fine enough to accurately measure longitude and latitude. You knew that the site was nearby. You dug, and you ordered the workers to dig, even without the box. As you listen to the plane and rub your aching eyes, you pray they left you supplies enough to find the pyramid and to survive, and that the plane's carrying the long-overdue box.

Your Tent
(You are in the army cot.)
You are in your tent. Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little.
At the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off cot], InteractiveFictionGame[look up southern]
> unlock trunk
What do you want to unlock the trunk with? Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off cot], InteractiveFictionGame[look up southern]
> look up southern
You see canvas. What else?

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off cot], InteractiveFictionGame[look up southern]
> take off cot
You push yourself up and manage to get out of the cot. Your legs are a little wobbly, though, and your head swims.

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[take in cot], InteractiveFictionGame[close cot]
> south
Outside Your Tent
You are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. To the south you can see a firepit and to the north is the entrance to your tent. Everything is oddly quiet, unsettling, creating a feeling of floating anxiety. The stillness seems to enhance the eerie quality of the desert, the feeling of being truly alone. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

You crane your neck and see a plane, high overhead, circling the encampment. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[northeast], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]
> east
Northern Path
You are on an east/west path on the northern side of the encampment. To the east you can see the sites of previous excavations your workers had begun before they deserted you. Low, gentle sand dunes roll out of sight to the north, but your camp's eastern border has a path, heading off to the south, which starts here. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

The plane seems to be circling right overhead. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]
> south
Middle Path
You are at the eastern edge of an east/west path in the middle of the camp. To the west you can see the firepit and beyond that the supply tent. To the east you can see the desert -- a vista difficult to avoid seeing from just about anywhere in the camp. A north/south path intersects here, traveling along the eastern border of the camp. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

The plane seems to be circling right overhead. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[northwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[northeast], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]
> east
Desert
You are in the desert, still within sight of the encampment, just a tiny oasis to the west. The tents, shimmering behind the heat waves rising from the sand, seem to be calling you back, beckoning, offering safety and refuge. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

You look up to see a small speck appear right beneath the plane -- probably a parachute. The plane heads off far to the northwest, dipping its wings in a salute. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[northwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[northeast], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]
> north
Desert
You are in the broiling sands of the desert, a short distance from the camp. Off to the west you can just make out a slight discoloration in the sand, the start of an east/west path which borders the northern edge of the camp. There's an enlarged hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

A small speck descending from the plane overhead gets larger until you see a crate, dangling from a parachute. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[look west], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]
> look west
Please be more specific. LOOKing AT, BEHIND, UNDER, THROUGH, INSIDE, ON, DOWN, FOR, or any other method of LOOKing mean different things to me. Please specify which preposition you'd like to use next time, like LOOK AT THE direction, or LOOK INSIDE THE direction.

At last, your luck seems to be changing. A large crate lands right before you, its parachute flapping in the breeze. The parachute breaks away from the crate and drifts off in the wind. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take crate], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[open crate], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]
> open crate
The crate opens slowly, the boards creaking with the strain. Opening the packing crate reveals a navigation box.
