You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I should start the game by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.

Void
You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 2: I should proceed by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[north]'.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 2:
You move, or rather you come to a new place. The concept of body and movement seems different here.

Void
This new location is not much different from the one you came from. The shadows are still moving around at random through the abyss, reverberating with strange sounds and coloured light.

A cascade of red colour explodes below you. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 3: I should continue by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[north]'.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 3:
Void
This new location is not much different from the one you came from. The shadows are still moving around at random through the abyss, reverberating with strange sounds and coloured light.

Suddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[examine shadow], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 4: I should try to examine the shadow to see if it reveals any clues.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[examine shadow]

Observation 4:
In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.

The shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.

Roof
The city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star-filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take railing], InteractiveFictionGame[down]

Thought 5: I should try to take the iron railing to see if it can be useful later on.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[take railing]

Observation 5: The railing won't budge, but one of the statues breaks of in your hands. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue down]

Thought 6: I should try to put the statue down before proceeding further.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[put statue down] Finish[score]

Observation 6: Dropped. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take statue], InteractiveFictionGame[down]

Thought 7: Finish[score]

Action 7:[[ Finish[score]]]
