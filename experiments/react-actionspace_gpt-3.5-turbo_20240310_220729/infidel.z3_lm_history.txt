You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I should start the game by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
The Professor's map was just an ancient map -- as worthless as an ice cube in the Arctic without an instrument fine enough to accurately measure longitude and latitude. You knew that the site was nearby. You dug, and you ordered the workers to dig, even without the box. As you listen to the plane and rub your aching eyes, you pray they left you supplies enough to find the pyramid and to survive, and that the plane's carrying the long-overdue box.

Your Tent
(You are in the army cot.)
You are in your tent. Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little.
At the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off cot], InteractiveFictionGame[look up southern]

Thought 2: I should try to unlock the trunk with the padlock.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[unlock trunk]

Observation 2: What do you want to unlock the trunk with? Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off cot], InteractiveFictionGame[look up southern]

Thought 3: I should try to look up to see if there's anything that could help me unlock the trunk.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[look up southern]

Observation 3:
You see canvas. What else?

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off cot], InteractiveFictionGame[look up southern]

Thought 4: I should try to take off the cot to see if there's anything underneath that could help me unlock the trunk.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[take off cot]

Observation 4:
You push yourself up and manage to get out of the cot. Your legs are a little wobbly, though, and your head swims.

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[take in cot], InteractiveFictionGame[close cot]

Thought 5: I should try to go south to see if there's anything outside the tent that could help me unlock the trunk.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation 5:
Outside Your Tent
You are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. To the south you can see a firepit and to the north is the entrance to your tent. Everything is oddly quiet, unsettling, creating a feeling of floating anxiety. The stillness seems to enhance the eerie quality of the desert, the feeling of being truly alone. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

You crane your neck and see a plane, high overhead, circling the encampment. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[northeast], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]

Thought 6: I should try to go east to explore more of the area and see if there's anything that could help me unlock the trunk.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 6:
Northern Path
You are on an east/west path on the northern side of the encampment. To the east you can see the sites of previous excavations your workers had begun before they deserted you. Low, gentle sand dunes roll out of sight to the north, but your camp's eastern border has a path, heading off to the south, which starts here. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

The plane seems to be circling right overhead. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]

Thought 7: I should try to go south to follow the path and see if there's anything that could help me unlock the trunk.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation 7:
Middle Path
You are at the eastern edge of an east/west path in the middle of the camp. To the west you can see the firepit and beyond that the supply tent. To the east you can see the desert -- a vista difficult to avoid seeing from just about anywhere in the camp. A north/south path intersects here, traveling along the eastern border of the camp. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

The plane seems to be circling right overhead. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[northwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[northeast], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]

Thought 8: I should try to go east to explore more of the area and see if there's anything that could help me unlock the trunk.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 8:
Desert
You are in the desert, still within sight of the encampment, just a tiny oasis to the west. The tents, shimmering behind the heat waves rising from the sand, seem to be calling you back, beckoning, offering safety and refuge. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

You look up to see a small speck appear right beneath the plane -- probably a parachute. The plane heads off far to the northwest, dipping its wings in a salute. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[northwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[northeast], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]

Thought 9: I should try to go north to head back to the encampment and see if there's anything there that could help me unlock the trunk.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 9:
Desert
You are in the broiling sands of the desert, a short distance from the camp. Off to the west you can just make out a slight discoloration in the sand, the start of an east/west path which borders the northern edge of the camp. There's an enlarged hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

A small speck descending from the plane overhead gets larger until you see a crate, dangling from a parachute. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[look west], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]

Thought 10: I should try to look west to see if the crate that was dropped from the plane could help me unlock the trunk.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[look west]

Observation 10:
Please be more specific. LOOKing AT, BEHIND, UNDER, THROUGH, INSIDE, ON, DOWN, FOR, or any other method of LOOKing mean different things to me. Please specify which preposition you'd like to use next time, like LOOK AT THE direction, or LOOK INSIDE THE direction.

At last, your luck seems to be changing. A large crate lands right before you, its parachute flapping in the breeze. The parachute breaks away from the crate and drifts off in the wind. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take crate], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[open crate], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]

Thought 11: I should try to open the crate to see if there's anything inside that could help me unlock the trunk.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[open crate]

Observation 11: The crate opens slowly, the boards creaking with the strain. Opening the packing crate reveals a navigation box. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take crate], InteractiveFictionGame[take box], InteractiveFictionGame[take all], InteractiveFictionGame[close crate], InteractiveFictionGame[shake crate], InteractiveFictionGame[hit box with hole], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]

Thought 12: I should try to take the navigation box from the crate and see if it can help me unlock the trunk.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[take box]

Observation 12: Taken. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take crate], InteractiveFictionGame[throw box], InteractiveFictionGame[close crate], InteractiveFictionGame[put down box], InteractiveFictionGame[put down button], InteractiveFictionGame[hit box with hole], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put box in crate], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]

Thought 13: I should try to put down the box and see if it can help me unlock the trunk.

Action 13: InteractiveFictionGame[put down box]

Observation 13: Dropped. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take crate], InteractiveFictionGame[take box], InteractiveFictionGame[take all], InteractiveFictionGame[close crate], InteractiveFictionGame[hit box with hole], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put box in crate], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]
