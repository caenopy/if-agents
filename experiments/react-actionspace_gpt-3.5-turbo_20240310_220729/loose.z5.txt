What was that?

You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.

"No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind."

After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.

Rickety Fence
The ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other. Although it hasn't fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and if that egg isn't careful...

The footpath running along the fence veers sharply north.

The egg hums a little tune your mother used to sing at bedtime. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[ask egg about graffiti], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

The egg scrutinizes you over the top of his spectacles. "You must be new in town; I thought everyone had heard: Mother Loose has disappeared! A most unfortunate incident." He glances furtively all around before motioning you to step closer. "The circumstances were quite baffling; one can't help but speculate. Can you keep a secret?"

> yes
The egg leans forward and almost tumbles off the fence, but recovers just in time. "Shhh! Don't breathe a word. She's been kidnapped by terrorists. The authorities want to avoid a panic, of course, but rumors are flying." Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Bravely, the egg calls after you: "My life is in your hands! I trust you will return shortly to rescue me!"

Forest
The sun has disappeared. Only a narrow north-south passage winds through the forest here; trees and gnarled undergrowth barricade all other exits. Chill air seeps up from the ground and coils around your body, reaching down your neck with insistent, clammy fingers. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Deep Forest
Wet branches slap your face, their icy needles stinging. Dense underbrush creeps in from all sides. With each step, mud oozes into your shoes. Insects drop from above and crawl through your hair; knuckles scrape against rough bark. The path hooks from south to southwest here, slithering between the trees like a snake. Faint rustling sounds catch your ear, but when you turn to look, all is still and quiet.

At your feet, a green and yellow basket lies on its side. Whoever dropped it must have been in a hurry, because the contents have spilled out and are strewn everywhere.

An iron pot has come to rest at the edge of the footpath, near a tree.

You can also see a cracked porcelain dish and a bent spoon here.

Using the spoon's handle, you break the seal between pot and lid. Ever so cautiously, you lift the lid and peek into the pot but, spooked by a blood-curdling howl nearby, you jerk your arm back abruptly. The lid flies out of your grasp and rolls out of sight.

Fortunately, you still have the pot. In it, you see some pease porridge.

You glance around nervously. The rustling seems very close now.

Ecchhh! Nasty stuff. You decide to get rid of it before someone gets sick. You look around for an inconspicuous spot, and hastily dump the pease porridge. It soaks into the ground, but a shiny golden hairpin remains!
