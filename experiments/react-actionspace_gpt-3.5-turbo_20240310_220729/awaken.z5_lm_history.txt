You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I should start the game by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
You remember darkness. And the cold. Cold and darkness. And silence. Those memories are all that you have. That, and a feeling that something you never knew you possessed has been lost.

Suddenly, oblivion is split by a blinding light and a crash of sound. You awaken to the roar of a storm and a deluge of rain and mud.

In the Mud
Rain and muddy water are pouring down on you, making it difficult to see or even breathe. Sodden earth and mud surrounds you on all sides except overhead, where flashes of lightning illuminate a storm tossed sky. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[put mud under sky], InteractiveFictionGame[put sky under mud], InteractiveFictionGame[put rain under mud], InteractiveFictionGame[put water under mud], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 2: I should try to find a way to get out of the rain and mud. I'll take the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[up]'.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Observation 2:
As you scramble out of the hole the mud collapses downward, filling in the hole behind you.

Graveyard
Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The only exit is through the gate to the east.

A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the graveyard.

A large branch has been broken from one of the trees and has crushed the grave marker below it. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take branch], InteractiveFictionGame[take limb], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[push limb to trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put trees under grave], InteractiveFictionGame[put grave under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put church under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put windows under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put markers under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put branch under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put mold under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put wind under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put rain under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put ground under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put ivy under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put limb under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put steeple under trees], InteractiveFictionGame[put east under trees]

Thought 3: I should explore the graveyard further and maybe try to find a way out. I'll head towards the church by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[east]'.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 3:
West Side of the Church
This side of the church is untended and grasses and weeds have run rampant. A muddy trail leads back to the graveyard to the west and on to the southeast and a faint path continues around the church to the northeast.

To the east, the wall of the church breaks some of the force of the wind. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[put weeds under church], InteractiveFictionGame[put church under weeds], InteractiveFictionGame[put wind under weeds], InteractiveFictionGame[put west under weeds], InteractiveFictionGame[put southeast under weeds], InteractiveFictionGame[put windows under weeds], InteractiveFictionGame[put rain under weeds], InteractiveFictionGame[put trail under weeds], InteractiveFictionGame[put east under weeds], InteractiveFictionGame[put mud under weeds], InteractiveFictionGame[put northeast under weeds], InteractiveFictionGame[put chain under weeds], InteractiveFictionGame[put steeple under weeds]

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[northeast]

Observation 4:
North Side of the Church
The trees close in here, their storm-tossed branches seeming to reach clawing limbs towards the back of the church. The weeds have run wild here and ivy climbs its way up the back of the building.  A faint path continues around the church to the southeast and the southwest.

The south wall of the church looms blankly overhead.

Lightning arcs overhead, followed instantly by a blast of thunder. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[put church under storm], InteractiveFictionGame[put storm under church], InteractiveFictionGame[put trees under church], InteractiveFictionGame[put ivy under church], InteractiveFictionGame[put southeast under church], InteractiveFictionGame[put windows under church], InteractiveFictionGame[put rain under church], InteractiveFictionGame[put path under church], InteractiveFictionGame[put mud under church], InteractiveFictionGame[put southwest under church], InteractiveFictionGame[put chain under church], InteractiveFictionGame[put north under church], InteractiveFictionGame[put weeds under church], InteractiveFictionGame[put steeple under church], InteractiveFictionGame[put south under church]

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 5:
East Side of the Church
This wide, graveled clearing may have once been where the worshippers at the church left their vehicles while attending services inside. If so, it seems that the last service was held long ago. Weeds and grasses grow up through the gravel, which is littered with debris. Dark, looming trees surround the clearing except for the driveway, which leads to the southwest, and for a narrow opening to the northwest.
