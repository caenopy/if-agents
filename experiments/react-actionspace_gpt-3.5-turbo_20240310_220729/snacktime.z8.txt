Sitting Room
This is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food. That is a good room.

Even though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of "no"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.

Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[push pet], InteractiveFictionGame[kiss on pet], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Food Room
Food room, glorious food room!

Your bowl for food and water is here, but that's only the beginning. There's also a lot of secret places where your pet keeps food and things that go with food and things that make food better. There's a thing that gets hot and a box that stays cold, and that is your favorite because you know there is always food inside there. A cloth hangs down from the door of the cold box.

> open box
This is a good trick!

You pull on the cloth with your teeth and back up as the door opens. Inside you can see various leftovers, some jars, some sandwich fixings and one shiny can.

> examine box
The cold box hums softly. It must be happy because it has a lot of food inside it. That always makes you happy.

Right now it's open and blasting you with cold air. Inside you can see various leftovers, some jars, some sandwich fixings and one shiny can.

> take all
leftovers: All the food in the cold box is up too high for you or closed away. Looks like you will need your pet to help you get a snack.
jars: Jars are no good for you, they just tease you by letting you see what's inside. But you can't get them open without your pet's help anyway.
sandwich fixings: All the food in the cold box is up too high for you or closed away. Looks like you will need your pet to help you get a snack.
shiny can: You snatch up the shiny can with your mouth and hold on tight.
