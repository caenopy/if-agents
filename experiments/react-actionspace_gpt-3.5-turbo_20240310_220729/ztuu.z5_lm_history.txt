You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I should start the game by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you."

"What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly.

"Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages."

"And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully.

"A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever.

"But what of Kolchack the --"

"Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!"  He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!"

And with that, you embark on...

New Excavation
You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take into tunnel], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought 2: I should take the lantern into the tunnel to explore further.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[take into tunnel]

Observation 2:
As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!

Tunnel
You are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought 3: I should head east to see if there's a way out of this tunnel.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 3:
Cultural Complex
This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period."  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription "Convention Center."  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science." Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Thought 4: I should head north towards the Convention Center to see if there's a way out of this complex.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 4:
Convention Center Lobby
You are standing at the entrance of the GUE Convention Center. On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust. Although the whole cultural center appears to have been long-abandoned, loud, low-pitched sounds emanate from the door standing open to the north. And while these sounds most closely approximate those made by under-lubricated granola fabricators, they nonetheless fill you with dread. Next to the door is a sign, and to the sign's left (northwest to you) is a souvenir stand. The cultural center's lobby lies to the south. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[take into northwest], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought 5: I should investigate the sounds coming from the open door to the north.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[take into northwest]

Observation 5:
Souvenir Stand
You find yourself standing in front of a souvenir stand that is clearly affiliated with the Convention Center. An odd-looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye-catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.

On the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.

You can see a salesman here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[hit salesman], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[talk to salesman], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[eat popcorn], InteractiveFictionGame[examine finger], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern on counter], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword on counter], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on counter]

Thought 6: I should talk to the odd-looking salesman to see if he has any information that could help me find a way out of this complex.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[talk to salesman]

Observation 6:
Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.

Two things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[take mask], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[talk to salesman], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[eat popcorn], InteractiveFictionGame[examine finger], InteractiveFictionGame[examine mask], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern on counter], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword on counter], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on counter]

Thought 7: I should try to take the mask from the odd-looking salesman to see if it reveals anything helpful.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[take mask]

Observation 7:
With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face. In hellish harmony, two terrifying screams fill the air: yours, as the first human to see a grue; and his, as prelude to a graphic demonstration of why it is that they aren't seen by light of day (to wit: spontaneous grueish combustion, leaving only a greasy slick on the ground by your feet.) Although you will spend the rest of your life trying to forget what you have just seen, the sight of that sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed face and razor-like fingers remains forever etched in your mind. You throw the mask away in horror at what you've just seen.

[Your score has just gone up by eight points.] Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[take gores], InteractiveFictionGame[take rune], InteractiveFictionGame[take postcards], InteractiveFictionGame[take multi], InteractiveFictionGame[take popcorn], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[eat popcorn], InteractiveFictionGame[examine finger], InteractiveFictionGame[lower gores], InteractiveFictionGame[lower rune], InteractiveFictionGame[lower postcards], InteractiveFictionGame[lower multi], InteractiveFictionGame[lower popcorn], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern], InteractiveFictionGame[throw gores], InteractiveFictionGame[throw rune], InteractiveFictionGame[throw postcards], InteractiveFictionGame[throw multi], InteractiveFictionGame[throw popcorn], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern on counter], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword on counter], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on counter]

Thought 8: I should continue exploring this area and see if there are any more clues or items that could help me find a way out.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 8: Convention Center Lobby Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[take into northwest], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought 12:[[ I have explored as much as I can in this area. It's time to finish and see my final score.
