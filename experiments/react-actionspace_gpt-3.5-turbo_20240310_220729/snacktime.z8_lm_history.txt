You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

Sitting Room
This is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food. That is a good room.

Even though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of "no"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.

Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[push pet], InteractiveFictionGame[kiss on pet], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Thought 2: I should probably go west to the room with the food.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Observation 2:
Food Room
Food room, glorious food room!

Your bowl for food and water is here, but that's only the beginning. There's also a lot of secret places where your pet keeps food and things that go with food and things that make food better. There's a thing that gets hot and a box that stays cold, and that is your favorite because you know there is always food inside there. A cloth hangs down from the door of the cold box. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[open box], InteractiveFictionGame[open all], InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Thought 3: I should open the cold box to see if there's any food inside.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[open box]

Observation 3:
This is a good trick!

You pull on the cloth with your teeth and back up as the door opens. Inside you can see various leftovers, some jars, some sandwich fixings and one shiny can. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[push door], InteractiveFictionGame[look in box], InteractiveFictionGame[take all], InteractiveFictionGame[examine box], InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Thought 4: I should examine the shiny can to see what it is.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[examine box]

Observation 4:
The cold box hums softly. It must be happy because it has a lot of food inside it. That always makes you happy.

Right now it's open and blasting you with cold air. Inside you can see various leftovers, some jars, some sandwich fixings and one shiny can. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[push door], InteractiveFictionGame[look in box], InteractiveFictionGame[take all], InteractiveFictionGame[examine box], InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Thought 5: I should take the shiny can and see if it's something I can eat.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[take all]

Observation 5:
leftovers: All the food in the cold box is up too high for you or closed away. Looks like you will need your pet to help you get a snack.
jars: Jars are no good for you, they just tease you by letting you see what's inside. But you can't get them open without your pet's help anyway.
sandwich fixings: All the food in the cold box is up too high for you or closed away. Looks like you will need your pet to help you get a snack.
