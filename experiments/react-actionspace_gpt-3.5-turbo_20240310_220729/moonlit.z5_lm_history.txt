You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I should start the game by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
No, not a prison, though stone stands around you, as expressionless as a mirror awaiting face and form; and in the silence you hear no plaint of flute or roar of gong, but instead the crash of porcelain shattering.

You can see a porcelain mask here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take egg], InteractiveFictionGame[take mask], InteractiveFictionGame[get in stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[take all], InteractiveFictionGame[push mask to stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[down]

Observation 8:
Shadow Armory
Shadows gather around you. For a moment, dregs of light defined by the negative space take on the shapes of maple leaf, kite, comb, and other shapes that flicker across the walls too rapidly for you to interpret.

Curiously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.

Northward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take dagger], InteractiveFictionGame[get in stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[push dagger to stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[get in stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[put dagger down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[put dagger on stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 11: I seem to have made a mistake in my input. Let's try heading west instead to see where that path leads.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Observation 11:
The shapes of light you saw as you entered fade irrevocably.


Silent Symphony
A single bronze gong hangs from its wooden frame in the room's center. There are also silk cushions arranged around the floor in a court ensemble's traditional half-circle, but no bamboo flutes or clay ocarinas, nine-stringed zithers or singers' unfolding fans, are in evidence. A mural that touches each wall in turn gives the room an illusion of greater depth. 

Two entrances, one east, one north; the former is wrapped in shadow, the latter in light. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[get in cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[put dagger down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[look in cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[put dagger on cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on cushions]

Thought 12: I should investigate the bronze gong and see if there's anything significant about it. Let's try interacting with it.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[get in cushions] Finish[score]

Observation 12: You can't see any such thing. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[get in cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[put dagger down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[look in cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[put dagger on cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on cushions]

Thought 13: It seems I made a mistake in my input again. Let's try heading east this time to explore the shadow-wrapped entrance and see what lies beyond.

Action 13: InteractiveFictionGame[east] Finish[score]

Observation 13: That's not a verb I recognise. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[get in cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask down], InteractiveFictionGame[put dagger down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[look in cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[put mask on cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[put dagger on cushions], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on cushions]

Thought 14: It seems I'm unable to progress further in this game due to unrecognized commands. I will Finish[score] here.

Action 14:[[ Finish[score]]]
