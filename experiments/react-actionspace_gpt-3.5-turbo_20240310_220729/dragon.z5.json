[{"observation": "The faces of the council members look grim. Gilgern continues to speak. \n\"Of course, something must be done soon,\" he says in that gruff, hearty voice you have come to dislike so much. \"Must restore public confidence and encourage the return of people to the land. Can't just leave the place to the likes of dragons and trolls. We must all make money again. Isn't as though it's just arrived, dragon's been there for years. Just that people found out about it, that's all.\" \nMarzipam looks round nervously at the others in the so-called Council of the Wise. \n\"Of course, we can't afford to pay you much. We are just poor men ourselves. Think of this more as a civic duty...\" he wheezes. \nAround you the other travellers and adventurers shift nervously. \nGilgern hurriedly adjusts his glasses and glances down at the scroll in front of him. \"Says here that the Great Worm can be beaten,\" he goes on. \"Sword of Erondil is the only weapon which can penetrate a dragon's scaly hide. Enchanted weapon, you see. Last seen many years ago in the Castle of Abercorn. Big, ugly place. Near the sea, I think, if memory serves me right. Dragon must be getting a bit careless and lazy by now. Been there all that time. Stands to reason. Might get in a lucky hit or something.\" \nMarzipam breaks in. \"Or there's the spell, I suppose. The dragon is supposed to be held in place under an old enchantment, though that's perhaps just an old tale. Break the spell and the dragon will leave, the story goes...\" \n\"Well, which of you is interested?\" Gilgern looks across at you and the other adventurers. You begin to wish you had never set foot in the town - it just happened to be on your journey, that's all. You've no wish to tangle with dangerous dragons or anything else. \nAs Gilgern looks down, you suddenly find that the other adventurers have all quietly taken a couple of steps back, leaving you out in the front. \n\"Splendid\", chortles Gilgern before you can say anything, \"We've one brave soul willing to risk their all for our little cause. Welcome, stranger...\" \nBefore you know it, you have been whisked away from the town square in a donkey and cart and deposited beside a track. \n\"Good luck - you'll need it!\" calls the driver over his shoulder, as he hurries away. \n\nWelcome to Dragon Adventure. You start your quest on a mountain path in the North-East... \n(Type INFO at any time for more playing information.)\n\nDragon Adventure\nA simple text adventure for players aged 9 and over, by William Stott\nRelease 2 / Serial number 040211 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 \n\nRocky Mountains\nIt is a clear, bright morning and all seems peaceful.
