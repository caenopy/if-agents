You awaken in your tent, lying on the floor, with a hangover like you wouldn't believe. As you lever yourself up, you notice that there is complete silence instead of the usual morning complaints of the workers and Roboff's usual shouting. This can only mean one thing - Roboff must have finally run off on you. Panicked, you look around and see your amulet lying on the floor. At least Roboff had the sense to not trigger off your alarm. Knowing him, he also had the sense to take the emergency radio. How the megakrip are you going to get out of this one?
