You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends.

Thought: I should start by exploring my surroundings and looking for any clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
A beautiful day in Bostwin! You are awakened by a ray of sunlight peeking through a window shade and rise refreshed after a restful night's sleep.  You've given your Company a weekend pass to get some R&R after your last grueling mission.  Wasting precious little time your entire company took off for the city proper to pack in as much drinking, carousing, brawling, wenching and other relaxing pursuits as possible in 48 hours.  In the fields of battle your men are an elite unit of trained professionals.  Off-duty they're pretty much like every other bunch of soldiers you've ever served with. 

A weekend off and what to do? After the challenges of the past year when you were first promoted and assumed command of Charlie Company you've nearly forgotton what free time is and what you're supposed to do with it.

Your Quarters
Rank certainly does have its privileges.  When you were a lowly lieutenant you had to share cramped quarters with a fellow lieutenant at your previous assignment.  Commanding a company of your own affords you the luxury of private, spacious quarters just outside the barracks themselves. As a further abuse of your power your chest and bunk are not standard issue items from the Pentari millitary supply center.

You can see a postcard here.

Thought: I should start by examining the postcard to see if there are any clues or hints on it.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine postcard]

Observation:
It's addressed to you...

!!! Hello, Adventurer !!!

Welcome to the world of Pentari.  Pentari is a spirited land which may conjure warm feelings of a distant time and a fallen empire far away. Be sure to always carry your sword as anything can and probably will happen!

Disclaimer:The Implementor of this world is in no way responsible for loss of sleep, time, job, significant other or any other losses you may incur as a result of your visit(s) here.  Any and all access to Pentari is offered "as-is" without any warranty of any kind either expressed or implied!

Thought: I should make sure to take my sword with me as the postcard suggests that it's important for the adventure.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[take sword]

Observation: You already have that.

Thought: Since I already have the sword, I should now explore my surroundings further to see if there are any other items or clues that could be useful.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[look around]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Reflect: I have made progress by examining the postcard and ensuring I have my sword with me. I need to continue exploring my surroundings to find more clues or items that could help me in the game.

Thought: I should try to look around more carefully and see if there are any hidden items or clues in my quarters.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[look around]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought: It seems the game is not recognizing my command to look around. I should try a different action to progress further.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[check inventory]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems the game is not recognizing my command to check my inventory. I should try another action to see if I can make progress.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go outside]

Thought: It appears that the game is not recognizing some of my commands. I should try a more straightforward action to see if I can progress further.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[move]

Observation:
(the postcard)
Nothing obvious happens.

Thought: Since the game is not responding to my actions as expected, I should try to interact with the postcard again to see if there are any hidden clues or messages.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine postcard]

Observation:
It's addressed to you...

Reflect: I seem to be stuck in a loop with the postcard. I need to find a way to progress further in the game by exploring other areas or trying different actions.

Thought: I should try to leave my quarters and explore the barracks to see if there are any other items or clues that could help me in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[leave quarters]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems the game is not recognizing my command to leave my quarters. I should try another action to see if I can make progress.

Thought: Since the game is not recognizing my command to exit the room, I should try a different approach to move forward.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[open door]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems the game is not recognizing my command to open the door. I should try another action to see if I can make progress.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go to barracks]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It appears that the game is not recognizing my commands to leave my quarters or explore further. I should try to interact with the postcard again to see if there are any hidden clues or messages that could help me progress.

Reflect: I seem to be stuck in a loop with the postcard. I need to find a way to progress further in the game by exploring other areas or trying different actions. I should focus on finding a way to leave my quarters and explore other locations to advance in the game.

Thought: I should try to find a way to exit my quarters and explore other areas in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[try to leave room]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought: It seems the game is not recognizing my command to leave the room. I should try another action to see if I can make progress.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[open window]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems the game is not recognizing my command to open the window. I should try another action to see if I can make progress.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[search room]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems the game is not recognizing my command to search the room. I should try another action to see if I can make progress.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[look for exit]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought: It seems the game is not recognizing my command to look for an exit. I should try another action to see if I can make progress.

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Reflect: I seem to be struggling to find a way to leave my quarters and explore other areas in the game. The game is not recognizing many of my commands, so I need to think of a different approach to progress further. I should focus on finding a way to exit my current location and explore new areas to advance in the game.

Thought: I should try to interact with different objects in my quarters to see if there are any hidden clues or items that could help me find a way out.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine chest]

Observation: This is certainly not standard issue, it's a nice chestnut dresser with four large draws crested by a double door on top.

Thought: I should try to open the chestnut dresser to see if there's anything inside that could help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[open dresser]

Observation: That's not something you can open.

Thought: It seems I cannot open the dresser. I should try a different action to see if I can find a way to leave my quarters and explore other areas.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[check drawers]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems the game is not recognizing my command to check the drawers. I should try another action to see if I can make progress.

Thought: It seems the game is not recognizing my command to inspect the dresser. I should try another action to see if I can make progress.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[open drawers]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Reflect: I am still struggling to find a way to leave my quarters and explore other areas in the game. The game is not recognizing many of my commands, so I need to think of a different approach to progress further. I should focus on interacting with different objects in my quarters to see if there are any hidden clues or items that could help me find a way out.
