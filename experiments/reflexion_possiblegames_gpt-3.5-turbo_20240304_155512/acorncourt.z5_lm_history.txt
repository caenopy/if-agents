You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends.

Thought: I should start by exploring my surroundings and looking for any clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
GREAT.  THEY'VE DONE IT TO ME AGAIN.  You think to yourself. THEY'VE STUCK ME IN ANOTHER ONE OF THEIR SILLY SCENARIOS.  You glance about with a look of irritation on your face.  WELL, I'LL SHOW THEM.  I'LL MAKE SHORT WORK OF THEIR STUPID LITTLE PUZZLE...

THE ACORN COURT
An Interactive Text Adventure

Standard interpreter 1.0

Court Yard
A good sized courtyard with an air of late British colonialism about it.  To the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall with an ornate iron gate set into the rock.  The walls of a large stone mansion rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south.  In the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window.  On top of the west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of sticks, twigs, and leaves.

A carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net.  In one corner of the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light.  The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green.  Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone.

A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine.

The tennis ball launching machine sitting in one corner of the yard looks like a relic from the 1930s.

Thought: I should start by examining the rusty tin pail and the tennis ball launching machine to see if there are any items I can collect or interact with.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine rusty tin pail]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems like the rusty tin pail might not be interactable at the moment. I should try examining the tennis ball launching machine next.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine tennis ball launching machine]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It appears that neither the rusty tin pail nor the tennis ball launching machine are interactable. I should explore other areas of the courtyard to see if there are any items or clues that could help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[explore courtyard]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Reflect: Progress so far has been slow as I haven't found any interactable items yet. I need to keep exploring and trying different actions to uncover clues or items that can help me advance.

Thought: I should try examining the large oak tree and the well of crumbling stone to see if there are any items hidden there.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine large oak tree]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems like the large oak tree might not have any interactable items. I should try examining the well of crumbling stone next to see if there's anything there.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine well of crumbling stone]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the small water well.

Thought: It seems like the game didn't recognize my command correctly. I should try a different action to interact with the well of crumbling stone.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[inspect well of crumbling stone]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought: It seems like the game is being very specific with its commands. I should try a more straightforward action to interact with the well of crumbling stone.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[check well]

Observation: A very small well suffering from age.  It is probably meant primarily as decoration, however, for authenticity, it is also functional.  This is made obvious by the crank and length of rope mounted above it.

Thought: I should try using the crank and length of rope on the well to see if there's anything hidden inside that could help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[use crank and rope on well]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Reflect: Progress has been slow, but I managed to find an interactable object, the well. I need to keep exploring and trying different actions to uncover more clues or items that can help me advance.

Thought: I should try using the crank on the well directly to see if there's anything hidden inside that could help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[use crank on well]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought: It seems like the game is very specific with its commands. I should try a different approach to interact with the well and see if there's anything hidden inside.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[turn crank on well]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to turn the hand crank and rope assembly on.

Thought: It looks like I need to be more specific with my actions. I should try turning the hand crank and rope assembly on the well to see if there's anything hidden inside.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[turn hand crank on well]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to turn the hand crank and rope assembly on.

Thought: It seems like the game is not recognizing my command correctly. I should try a different action to interact with the well and see if there's anything hidden inside.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[turn crank]

Observation: You turn the crank slowly raising the old tattered rope to reveal it's frayed end.

Thought: Turning the crank raised the rope, revealing its frayed end. I should examine the frayed end of the rope to see if there's anything attached to it that could help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine frayed end of rope]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Reflect: Progress has been slow, but I managed to interact with the well and raise the frayed end of the rope. I need to keep exploring and trying different actions to uncover more clues or items that can help me advance.

Thought: I should try pulling on the frayed end of the rope to see if there's anything hidden inside the well that could help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[pull frayed end of rope]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems like pulling on the frayed end of the rope might not be the correct action. I should try a different approach to interact with the well and see if there's anything hidden inside.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[lower rope into well]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought: It seems like the game is not recognizing my command correctly. I should try a different action to interact with the well and see if there's anything hidden inside.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[lower frayed end of rope into well]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought: It seems like the game is being very specific with its commands. I should try a more straightforward action to interact with the well and see if there's anything hidden inside.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[lower rope]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought: It appears that the game is not recognizing my commands correctly when trying to interact with the well. I should try a different approach to see if there are other items or clues in the courtyard that could help me progress.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[explore courtyard]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Reflect: Progress has been slow, and the game seems to be very specific with its commands. I need to think outside the box and try different actions to uncover more clues or items that can help me advance. I should continue exploring the courtyard and looking for interactable objects.

Thought: I should try examining the large stone mansion and the iron gate to see if there are any items or clues that could help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine large stone mansion]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems like the large stone mansion might not have any interactable items. I should try examining the iron gate next to see if there's anything there.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine iron gate]

Observation: A painfully detailed, ornate iron gate crafted to fit the European styling of the court yard.  The heavy, stout bars block your exit.  Upon closer inspection you find a small key hole in the border of the iron barrier.

Thought: I should try using the small key on the iron gate to see if it unlocks and helps me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[use small key on iron gate]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought: It seems like the game is not recognizing my command correctly. I should try a different action to interact with the iron gate and see if there's anything hidden behind it that could help me progress.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[unlock iron gate with small key]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It appears that the game is being very specific with its commands. I should try a more straightforward action to interact with the iron gate and see if there's anything hidden behind it that could help me progress.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[use key on iron gate]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Reflect: Progress has been slow, but I managed to find an interactable object, the iron gate. I need to keep exploring and trying different actions to uncover more clues or items that can help me advance. I should continue to search for items or clues in the courtyard that could assist me in unlocking the gate.

Thought: I should try examining the squirrels nest on top of the west wall and the large window in the east wall to see if there are any items or clues that could help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine squirrels nest]

Observation: A typical squirrels nest which looks more like a large wad of random woodland debris than the carefully woven, sturdy structure that it is.

Thought: It seems like the squirrels nest might not have any interactable items. I should try examining the large window in the east wall next to see if there's anything there.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine large window]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It appears that the large window in the east wall might not be interactable. I should try exploring other areas of the courtyard to see if there are any items or clues that could help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[explore courtyard]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought: Progress has been slow, and the game seems to be very specific with its commands. I should try a different approach to interact with the squirrels nest and the large window to see if there are any hidden items or clues that could help me progress.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[climb west wall to reach squirrels nest]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to climb the west wall.

Thought: It seems like the game didn't recognize my command correctly. I should try a different action to interact with the squirrels nest and see if there's anything hidden inside.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[climb wall]

Observation: Which do you mean, the north wall, the south wall, the east wall, the west wall, the northeast wall, the northwest wall, the southeast wall or the southwest wall?

Reflect: Progress has been slow, and the game is very specific with its commands. I need to be more precise in my actions and explore different areas of the courtyard to uncover more clues or items that can help me advance. I should continue to search for interactable objects and try different actions to progress in the game.

Thought: I should try examining the carpeting of old brown leaves on the ground and the ball machine to see if there are any items or clues that could help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine carpeting of old brown leaves]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems like the carpeting of old brown leaves might not have any interactable items. I should try examining the ball machine next to see if there's anything there.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine ball machine]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[look around courtyard]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
