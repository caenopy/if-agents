It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you."

"What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly.

"Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages."

"And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully.

"A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever.

"But what of Kolchack the --"

"Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!"  He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!"

And with that, you embark on...

New Excavation
You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.
> go northeast
As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!

Tunnel
You are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.
> search for tools
You can't see any such thing.
> explore the tunnel
That's not a verb I recognize.
> examine surroundings
You can't see any such thing.
> go back
You can't see any such thing.
> move boulders
Try as you might, the crystals won't budge.
> examine lantern and sword
You can't use multiple objects with that verb.
> examine lantern
The lantern, while of the cheapest construction, appears functional enough for the moment. Your best hope is that it stays that way. It looks like the lamp has gone through a few cycles of impact revitalization.
> examine sword
This is a cheaply-made sword of no antiquity whatsoever. With regard to grues or other underworldly denizens, your weapon is as likely to engender laughter as fear.
> search for hidden passages
You can't see any such thing.
> try to move boulders
That's not a verb I recognize.
> use lantern to search for hidden paths
I only understood you as far as wanting to use the brass lantern.
> examine walls and floor
You can't see any such thing.

The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.
