You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends.

Thought: I should start by exploring my surroundings and looking for any clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
This has never been your favorite part of the city.  Nor is this neighborhood the safest one.  But as a city sanitarian, you are charged with completing an annual health and safety inspection of every restaurant in your district.

Each day you visit three or four restaurants.  During those visits you take note of potential health code violations in your trusty notepad.  Today's first target:  Nikolai's Bar and Grill.

A hazy sun barely peeks above the three-story tenements.

Afflicted
An Interactive Fiction by Doug Egan
Release 1 / Serial number 080906 / Inform 7 build 5T18 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) 

Type "About" at any time to see game instructions and other notes from the author.

19th Street
You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street.  A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room.  The front entrance is north of you.

The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with broken bottles.  Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically.  A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak.

An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

A damp sheet of newspaper has blown up against the curb.

Thought: I should start by entering Nikolai's Bar and Grill and see what I can find inside.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go north]

Observation:
(first opening the front door)
(first unlocking the front door)
You lack a key that fits the front door.

Thought: I need to find a key to unlock the front door of Nikolai's Bar and Grill. I should search the area for any clues or items that might help me locate the key.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[search for key]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: I should try looking around the area more carefully, maybe there's a hidden spot where the key could be located.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[look around]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Reflect: Progress so far has been slow as I haven't found the key yet. I need to be more thorough in my search and pay attention to any details that might lead me to it.

Thought: I should check the area near the front door more closely for any hidden compartments or objects that could contain the key.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine front door area]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the front door.

Thought: I should try to interact with the front door directly to see if there's a way to open it without a key.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[open front door]

Observation:

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Reflect: I seem to be stuck at the front door of Nikolai's Bar and Grill. I need to think more creatively and consider different approaches to finding the key. I should explore other areas nearby and look for any hidden clues that might help me progress in the game.

Thought: I should try to explore the alley behind the restaurant to see if there's another entrance or any items that could be useful.
