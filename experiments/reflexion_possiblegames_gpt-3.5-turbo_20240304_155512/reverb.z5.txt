Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice.

Anyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new "Surfers Monthly" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening.

Shyeah, right. That's what YOU think.

Behind the Counter
You are behind the counter at "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor", where you are currently working. Not much of a job, but it keeps you from going broke during the nine months of the year when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing instructor. The rest of the parlor is southwest.

There is something pressing that you think you have to do, but you can't think what it might be.
> go southwest
You walk around to the front of the pizza parlor.

Pizza Parlor
You are standing in the middle of "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor". The counter separating you from the back of the parlor stretches in front of you on the northeast corner of the room. To the south is an exit to the street.
> check counter
It's a majorly boring counter which you're unfortunately very familiar with.  Hey, maybe that handwritten note lying next to a pizza box on the counter is related to whatever it is you're supposed to be doing now.
> read note
The note reads:

"Stanley,
    Don't forget to make your delivery to Mr. Calzone, located at the San Doppleton Courthouse. You're already on thin ice, kid. One more screwup and you can expect to be looking for a new job."

The note is signed with the initials "RT". The paper is official "Mr. Tasty's" stationery with the name Bob "Tasty" Tasker and lots of balloons and smiley faces all over the border. Isn't that cute?

Street, by Pizza Parlor
San Doppleton is where you live, work and play -- at least until summer. It has the typical California culture; which is to say, none. But at least it's just forty minutes' drive from Santa Barbara and the beach, so you can't complain much.

You stand in the heart of San Doppleton's main drag, the business district. The street goes east and west. The sidewalk runs by a pizza parlor, with a sewer vent nearby.

Two men bump into each other. They murmur apologies and go their separate ways.

Street, by Department Store
On this end of the street, a department store called Barkley's sits to the south.

You shouldn't leaving town until you deliver that pizza. It would cost you your job, and we all know how important THAT is to you.
