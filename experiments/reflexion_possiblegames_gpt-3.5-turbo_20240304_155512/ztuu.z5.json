[{"observation": "It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission,\" the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. \"We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you.\"\n\n\"What of Linklaw the Lucky?\" you ask shyly.\n\n\"Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages.\"\n\n\"And Fretsham the Fortunate?\" you ask hopefully.\n\n\"A fatality!\" the Inquisitor booms. \"Here,\" he says with evaporating patience, \"take these and be of good cheer.\" He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever.\n\n\"But what of Kolchack the --\"\n\n\"Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!\"  He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. \"Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!\"\n\nAnd with that, you embark on...\n\nZork: The Undiscovered Underground, a text adventure prequel to Zork Grand Inquisitor\nCopyright 1997 by Activision Inc.\nWritten by Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, programmed by Gerry Kevin Wilson.\nRelease 16 / Serial number 970828 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/2\nStandard interpreter 1.0\n\nNew Excavation\nYou are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.", "reward": 0, "moves": 1, "score": 0, "action": "Start"}, {"observation": "As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!\n\nTunnel\nYou are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.", "reward": 0, "moves": 2, "score": 0, "action": "go northeast"}, {"observation": "You can't see any such thing.", "reward": 0, "moves": 2, "score": 0, "action": "search for tools"}, {"observation": "That's not a verb I recognize.", "reward": 0, "moves": 2, "score": 0, "action": "explore the tunnel"}, {"observation": "You can't see any such thing.", "reward": 0, "moves": 2, "score": 0, "action": "examine surroundings"}, {"observation": "You can't see any such thing.", "reward": 0, "moves": 2, "score": 0, "action": "go back"}, {"observation": "Try as you might, the crystals won't budge.", "reward": 0, "moves": 3, "score": 0, "action": "move boulders"}, {"observation": "You can't use multiple objects with that verb.", "reward": 0, "moves": 3, "score": 0, "action": "examine lantern and sword"}, {"observation": "The lantern, while of the cheapest construction, appears functional enough for the moment.
