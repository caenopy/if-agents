You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends.

Thought: I should start by exploring my surroundings and looking for any clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you."

"What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly.

"Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages."

"And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully.

"A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever.

"But what of Kolchack the --"

"Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!"  He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!"

And with that, you embark on...

New Excavation
You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.

Thought: I should start by exploring the narrow tunnel to the northeast and see where it leads. I should also keep an eye out for any items or clues that could be useful on my journey.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go northeast]

Observation:
As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!

Tunnel
You are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.

Thought: I need to find a way to clear the boulders blocking the entrance so I can escape. I should search for any tools or objects that could help me move the boulders.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[search for tools]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: I should try to find another way to clear the boulders or find an alternate route out of the tunnel. I should continue exploring and see if there are any other paths or items that could help me escape.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[explore the tunnel]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognize.

Reflect: Progress so far has been challenging as I am currently trapped in the tunnel with boulders blocking the entrance. I need to find a way to clear the boulders or discover an alternate route to escape. I should continue exploring and searching for any tools or objects that could aid me in my escape.

Thought: I should carefully examine my surroundings in the tunnel to see if there are any hidden passages or objects that could help me escape.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine surroundings] Observ

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: I should try a different approach to find a way out of the tunnel. Perhaps I missed something earlier. I should go back and retrace my steps to see if there's anything I overlooked.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go back]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: I seem to be stuck in a loop with limited options. I should try a different action to see if it leads me to a new path or solution. I should attempt to interact with the boulders directly to see if there's a way to move them.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[move boulders]

Observation: Try as you might, the crystals won't budge.

Thought: Moving the boulders directly doesn't seem to be an option. I should look for any other objects or clues that could help me escape. I should also try to interact with the lantern and sword to see if they have any hidden functions.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine lantern and sword]

Observation: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

Thought: I should focus on one object at a time. I will start by examining the lantern to see if it has any hidden features that could help me escape.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine lantern]

Observation: The lantern, while of the cheapest construction, appears functional enough for the moment. Your best hope is that it stays that way. It looks like the lamp has gone through a few cycles of impact revitalization.

Reflect: Progress has been slow, and I am still trapped in the tunnel with no clear way out. I need to think outside the box and consider all possible options. I should continue examining the lantern and sword for any hidden features that could aid in my escape.

Thought: I should now focus on examining the sword to see if it has any special properties or functions that could help me escape the tunnel.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine sword]

Observation: This is a cheaply-made sword of no antiquity whatsoever. With regard to grues or other underworldly denizens, your weapon is as likely to engender laughter as fear.

Thought: The sword doesn't seem to be of much use in this situation. I should try a different approach to find a way out of the tunnel. I should carefully search the area for any hidden passages or objects that could help me escape.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[search for hidden passages]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: I need to find a way to escape this tunnel. I should try to interact with the boulders again to see if there's a way to move them. I should also consider using the lantern in a different way to see if it reveals any hidden paths.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[try to move boulders]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognize.

Thought: I seem to be stuck in a loop with limited options. I should try a different action to see if it leads me to a new path or solution. I should attempt to interact with the lantern in a different way to see if it reveals any hidden paths.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[use lantern to search for hidden paths]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to use the brass lantern.

Thought: Using the lantern to search for hidden paths didn't work. I should try a different approach. I should carefully examine the walls and floor of the tunnel to see if there are any loose rocks or hidden switches that could help me escape.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine walls and floor]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Reflect: Progress has been slow, and I am still struggling to find a way out of the tunnel. I need to think creatively and consider all possible options. I should continue exploring and examining my surroundings for any clues or objects that could help me escape.

Thought: I should try to interact with the boulders again to see if there's a way to move them. I should also consider using the sword in a different way to see if it can help me escape the tunnel.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[try to move boulders with sword]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognize.

Thought: I should try a different approach to move the boulders. I should carefully examine the boulders to see if there are any weak points or hidden mechanisms that could help me clear the entrance. I should also consider using the lantern in a different way to see if it can assist me in finding a solution.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine boulders]

Observation: The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.

Thought: The boulders are actually crystals. I should try to interact with them to see if there's a way to manipulate or move them. I should also consider using the lantern to inspect the crystals more closely for any clues or hidden features that could help me escape.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[interact with crystals]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognize.

Thought: I need to find a way to interact with the crystals to see if there's a way to move them. I should try using the lantern to inspect the crystals more closely for any clues or hidden features that could help me escape.

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to use the brass lantern.

Thought: Using the lantern to inspect the crystals didn't work. I should try a different approach.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine crystals with sword]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the boulders.

Reflect: Progress has been challenging, and I am still trapped in the tunnel with no clear way out. I need to find a way to interact with the crystals effectively to move them and escape. I should continue exploring and experimenting with different actions to find a solution.

Thought: I should focus on finding a way to interact with the crystals effectively. I should try using the sword to see if it can help me manipulate the crystals. I should also consider using the lantern in a different way to see if it reveals any hidden features of the crystals that could assist me in escaping.
