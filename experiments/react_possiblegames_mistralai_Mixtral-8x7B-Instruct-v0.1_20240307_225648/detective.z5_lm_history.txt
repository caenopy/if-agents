You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

<< Chief's office >>
You are standing in the Chief's office. He is telling you "The Mayor was murdered yeaterday night at 12:03 am. I want you to solve it before we get any bad publicity or the FBI has to come in. "Yessir!" You reply. He hands you a sheet of paper. Once you have read it, go north or west.

Just tell me if you like it or not.

Thought 3: This paper doesn't seem to contain any information about the Mayor's murder. I will proceed by taking the paper and then deciding whether to go north or west.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[take paper]

Observation 3:
Taken.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.] Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[put paper down], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 4: I have taken the paper, so I no longer need to read it. I will go north to investigate the scene of the crime.

Thought 5: I will explore the street to the west to see if there are any clues or leads related to the Mayor's murder.

Observation 5:
<< Outside >>
You are still on the streets. To the north is a restraunt where the mayor ate often. To the east is the Mayor's home.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.] Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put paper down]

Thought 6: I will first investigate the restaurant to the north where the mayor frequently ate. This could be a potential lead.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 6:
<< Restraunt >>
You are about to enter the restraunt when two guys jump you. They take your wallet and beat you a bit. Then you flash your badge and that riles them. Your body was discovered in a river 10 miles away.


    *** You have died ***


In that game you scored 30 out of a possible 360, in 5 turns.

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, give the FULL score for that game or QUIT? Valid actions:

Observation 43:
<< Restraunt >>
You are about to enter the restraunt when two guys jump you. They take your wallet and beat you a bit. Then you flash your badge and that riles them. Your body was discovered in a river 10 miles away.


    *** You have died ***


In that game you scored 40 out of a possible 360, in 17 turns.

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, give the FULL score for that game or QUIT? Valid actions: 

Thought 44: I will restart the game, as I have died again. I will try to avoid the previous mistake by not going to the restaurant with the mayor before investigating the Mayor's home. I will also make sure to take the pistol from the closet before leaving the Chief's office.
