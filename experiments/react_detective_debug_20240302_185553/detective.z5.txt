Just tell me if you like it or not.
If you want to talk to me over a BBS call the Ghostbuster Central BBS at (510)208-5657.
There is an Exile Games file area. Have fun. I WILL give hints out over the BBS to any of my games.

That's not a verb I recognise.

You can't see any such thing.
> Go west
<< Closet >>
You are in a closet. There is a gun on the floor. Better get it. To exit, go east.

<< Outside >>
You are outside in the cold. To the east is a dead end. To the west is the rest of the street. Papers are blowing around. It's amazingly cold for this time of year.
> Go west
<< Outside >>
You are still on the streets. To the north is a restraunt where the mayor ate often. To the east is the Mayor's home.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]
> Go north
<< Restraunt >>
You are about to enter the restraunt when two guys jump you. They take your wallet and beat you a bit. Then you flash your badge and that riles them. Your body was discovered in a river 10 miles away.


    *** You have died ***


In that game you scored 30 out of a possible 360, in 8 turns.

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, give the FULL score for that game or QUIT?
