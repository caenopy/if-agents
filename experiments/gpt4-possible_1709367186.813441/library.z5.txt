You are a student at Anycollege, in Anytown, and it's the end of the semester!  You've been slacking off all semester long, and it's catching up to you. That final paper is due for your Computer Science class ("The History of IF Games"), and you desperately need to check out a comprehensive book on Graham Nelson, one of the foremost authors of the obscure genre of interactive-fiction. You know there is exactly one such book, but you have no idea where it might be! 

The first time player should probably type "help".

Lobby
This is the entrance to the library. The circulation desk dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of desks and tables. A pair of security gates stands before the front doors to prevent people from stealing books. A card catalog lurks in a dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh flourescent light. Glass doors to the west lead to the book stacks; an archway to the northwest is labelled "Duplicating Services"; a door to the north bears a sign marked "Private" in large friendly letters; and the exit is to the east

You can see a circulation desk attendant here.
> talk to attendant
That's not a verb I recognise.
> ask attendant about book
"Try talking to the reference librarian."
> go to reference librarian
You can't see any such thing.
> go west

You push the glass doors open. Their hydraulics hiss faintly.

Ground Floor Stacks
This cavernous room is lit with flickering flourescent lighting which makes the ceiling look even lower than it really is. It is filled with half-empty shelves, upon which rest the dusty boxes of many early games. To one side sits a massive, ancient desk, its surface cluttered with paperwork. A sign on the wall indicates that this is the reference desk, which would make the prim young woman sitting behind it the reference librarian. A doorway to the north is labelled "Stairs", and glass doors lead east to the lobby.

You can see a reference librarian here.
> ask librarian about book
"What sort of book?  We have many books here!"
> ask librarian about Graham Nelson
"Ah, that valuable book. We keep it locked away, in the Rare Books Room."
> go to Rare Books Room
You can't see any such thing.
> ask librarian about Rare Books Room
"The Rare Books Room is on the second floor. Stairs are north of here. You will need the key, though."
> ask librarian for key
You can't see any such thing.
> ask librarian about key
"The key may be obtained at the circulation desk."
> go to circulation desk
You can't see any such thing.
> go east

You can see a circulation desk attendant here.
> ask attendant for key
The circulation desk attendant has better things to do.
> ask attendant about key
"You need to give me your ID card in order to get the key to the Rare Books Room."
> give ID to attendant
The circulation attendant gives you the key to the Rare Books Room, and he holds your ID card in exchange.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]
> go north
Perhaps you should examine the sign first.
> examine sign
The sign on the northern door says "Private" in large friendly letters, the same kind of lettering which is usually seen on signs saying "Attack-Trained Rottweilers Patrolling Premises After Business Hours".
> go west

> go north

Ground Floor Stairwell
Grungy stairs lead upwards, to the second level. A damaged picture hangs on the wall. The door to the ground floor shelving area is to the south.
> go upstairs
You can't see any such thing.
> go up stairs
I only understood you as far as wanting to go the ceiling.
> go up

Second Floor Stairwell
Grungy stairs lead downwards. The lights are dim, and a painting hangs on the wall. A door to the south appears to open into a room of shelves.
> go south

Second Floor Stacks
You are in a maze of twisty shelves, all alike.

(Well, okay, not really)

This cavernous room is filled with shelves as far as the eye can see. A doorway to the east is labelled "Computer Room", and the stairwell lies to the north.

A heavy wooden door bars the way to the rare books room. A sign indicates that the key may be obtained from the circulation desk.
> use key on door
That's not a verb I recognise.
> unlock door
(with the key)
You unlock the rare books door.
> open door
You open the rare books door.
> go through door
You can't go that way.
> go east

Computer Lab
This entire room hums with the combined output of several dozen computers. All of them are hopelessly out of date, but at least they're still good for word processing.

A bank of printers on one side of the room frantically churns out paper.

You can see a technician here.
> talk to technician
That's not a verb I recognise.
> speak to technician
I didn't understand that sentence.
> ask technician
What do you want to ask the technician for?
> ask for key
You can't see any such thing.
> look around
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> look at room
You can't see any such thing.
> look at computers
The faintly-glowing, phosphorescent screens are displaying various IF games in different positions. There are also some screen dumps, and the technician's terminal is showing a maze of twisty Web pages, all alike.
> look at technician's terminal
I only understood you as far as wanting to look at the technician.
> look at technician
This frazzled-looking man is thin and angular. He wears thick, slightly rose-tinted glasses, and exhibits nervous twitching. He is wearing a nametag.

He is leafing through a manual for security systems, and cursing the unreliability of the security gates.
> look at nametag
"Hi!  My name is Tom."
> talk to Tom
That's not a verb I recognise.
> speak to Tom
I didn't understand that sentence.
> ask Tom about security gates
The technician throws his hands up in frustration, slams the manual shut, tucks it under one arm and heads for the stairs. The air behind him positively smokes from the stream of invective he's producing.
