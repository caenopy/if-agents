Observation: A beautiful day in Bostwin! You are awakened by a ray of sunlight peeking through a window shade and rise refreshed after a restful night's sleep. You've given your Company a weekend pass to get some R&R after your last grueling mission. Wasting precious little time your entire company took off for the city proper to pack in as much drinking, carousing, brawling, wenching and other relaxing pursuits as possible in 48 hours. In the fields of battle your men are an elite unit of trained professionals. Off-duty they're pretty much like every other bunch of soldiers you've ever served with. A weekend off and what to do? After the challenges of the past year when you were first promoted and assumed command of Charlie Company you've nearly forgotton what free time is and what you're supposed to do with it.

History: Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go outside Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go north Observation: Charlie Company Compound Your company compound consists of three large buildings bordering a large, open area where company formations precede the orders of the day. To the west the Company's supply building can be seen while directly ahead of you lies your company's barracks which seem quieter than a crypt. Off to the east you hear the distant shouts of another Company drilling. Poor souls. Action: go to supply building Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go west Observation: Why would you want to inspect the Company's supply cache when you have a whole weekend off? Action: go east Observation: It's considered a breach of protocol to enter the compound of another company while training. You wisely decide to not step on any toes this time. Action: go to barracks Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go north Observation: Charlie Company Barracks If the Army of Bostwin were to publish a new edition of the soldier's handbook, a picture of this barracks should be included as the example other companies should follow. The floors are polished to an almost blinding shine while each of the bunks lining both sides of this building are perfectly made. Every locker next to each bunk is closed and locked. Not a single scrap of paper, not one article of clothing, nay not even a dust particle looks out of place. The powerful smell of high quantities of pine cleaner nearly burns your nostrils. Damn, you run a good comapny. You can see a Pentarian Transporter here. Action: look at Pentarian Transporter Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: look at locker Observation: These are ordinary metallic lockers, painted an olive green. Action: open locker
Observation: That's not something you can open.
Action:[[ look at bunks]]
