History: Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to exit. Action: exit Observation: You get out of the Pentarian Transporter. Charlie Company Barracks You can see a Pentarian Transporter here. Action: look at barracks Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: look at transporter Observation: One of the many wonders the Wizards of Pentari have developed is the transporter. The older, time-consuming methods of travel have been obviated by this elegantly simple device which can send the traveller over any distance in mere seconds simpy by stating your destination after entering the booth. As you are in an Army barracks and not a five star hotel this is one of the simplest models available. It's nothing more than a three sided booth pre-programmed to a single destination. A sign directly over the booth bears the simple legend 'City Transporter' over it. Action: enter transporter Observation: You get into the Pentarian Transporter. Action: say 'City Transporter' Observation: (to yourself) No reply. Action: push 'City Transporter' button Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Observation: It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you." "What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly. "Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages." "And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully. "A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever. "But what of Kolchack the --" "Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!" He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!" And with that, you embark on...

Release 16 / Serial number 970828 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/2 Standard interpreter 1.0 New Excavation You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.

Observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!

Observation: Cultural Complex This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period." With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription "Convention Center." To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science."

Observation: Theater This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.

History: Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: say 'City' Observation: (to yourself) No reply. Action: say 'City Transporter' Observation: (to yourself) No reply. Action: exit transporter Observation: It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you." "What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly. "Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages." "And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully. "A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever. "But what of Kolchack the --" "Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!" He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!" And with that, you embark on... Zork: The Undiscovered Underground, a text adventure prequel to Zork Grand Inquisitor Copyright 1997 by Activision Inc. Written by Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, programmed by Gerry Kevin Wilson. Release 16 / Serial number 970828 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/2 Standard interpreter 1.0 New Excavation You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow. Action: go northeast Observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped! Tunnel You are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens. Action: go northeast Observation: Cultural Complex This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period." With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription "Convention Center." To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science." Action: read sign Observation: The sign indicates today's performance, which (in honor of the festivities in the Convention Center) is "A Massacre on 34th Street." Action: go to Royal Theater Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go east Observation: Theater This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them. Action: go to stage Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go east
Observation: Stage The rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.) As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle.
Action:[[ look at footlights]]

As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle. Action: look at footlights Observation: The footlights form a long row along the front edge of the stage. They each consist of a candle covered by a small, round lens. Oddly enough, the lenses are virtually all black, except for a red lens, a blue lens, a green lens and a yellow lens directly in the center of the stage (perhaps this is where a solo performer would stand.) Stranger still, the footlights are glowing! Action: take red lens Observation: Yeow! That's hot! Need I add "sizzle"? Action: use sword on red lens Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to use the cheaply-made sword. Action: push red lens with sword Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: use gloves Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: look at gloves

History: Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go east Observation: Theater This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.

A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science."

History: Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: look at gloves Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: look in inventory Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: look at curtain Observation: Although unused for decades, the curtain seems to be in surprisingly good shape, though I wouldn't want to test that hypothesis myself. Action: pull curtain Observation: You pull sharply on the curtain, causing its fifty-two ton mass to fall to the floor. Needless to say, it's curtains for you. *** You have died *** In that game you scored 0 out of a possible 100, in 9 turns, earning you the rank of would-be adventurer. Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, give the FULL score for that game or QUIT Action: RESTART Observation: "It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you." "What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly. "Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages." "And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully. "A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever. "But what of Kolchack the --" "Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!" He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!" And with that, you embark on... Zork: The Undiscovered Underground, a text adventure prequel to Zork Grand Inquisitor Copyright 1997 by Activision Inc. Written by Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, programmed by Gerry Kevin Wilson. Release 16 / Serial number 970828 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/2 Standard interpreter 1.0 New Excavation You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow. Action: go northeast Observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped! Tunnel You are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens. Action: go northeast Observation: Cultural Complex This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period." With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered.

Action: go to Royal Theater Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go east
Observation: Theater This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.

Action: go northeast Observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped! Tunnel You are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens. Action: go northeast Observation: Cultural Complex This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period." With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription "Convention Center." To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science." Action: read sign Observation: The sign indicates today's performance, which (in honor of the festivities in the Convention Center) is "A Massacre on 34th Street." Action: go to Royal Theater Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go east Observation: Theater This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them. Action: go to stage Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go east Observation: Stage The rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.) As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle. Action: look at footlights Observation: The footlights form a long row along the front edge of the stage. They each consist of a candle covered by a small, round lens. Oddly enough, the lenses are virtually all black, except for a red lens, a blue lens, a green lens and a yellow lens directly in the center of the stage (perhaps this is where a solo performer would stand.) Stranger still, the footlights are glowing! Action: take red lens Observation: Yeow! That's hot! Need I add "sizzle"? Action: use plastic sword
Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Zork: The Undiscovered Underground, a text adventure prequel to Zork Grand Inquisitor Copyright 1997 by Activision Inc. Written by Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, programmed by Gerry Kevin Wilson. Release 16 / Serial number 970828 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/2 Standard interpreter 1.0 New Excavation You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow. Action: go northeast Observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped! Tunnel You are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens. Action: go northeast
Observation: Cultural Complex This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period." With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription "Convention Center." To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science."

History: Observation: Yeow! That's hot! Need I add "sizzle"? Action: use plastic sword Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: look at plastic sword Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: look at debris Observation: The rubble and debris is pretty much your standard sort, filled with the remains of crumbling walls, fallen rock, frivolous adventurers, and the like. Action: move debris Observation: Unless you have been hiding some very large earth-moving equipment, I don't see how you're going to move the rubble. Action: look at curtain Observation: Although unused for decades, the curtain seems to be in surprisingly good shape, though I wouldn't want to test that hypothesis myself. Action: pull curtain Observation: You pull sharply on the curtain, causing its fifty-two ton mass to fall to the floor. Needless to say, it's curtains for you. *** You have died *** In that game you scored 0 out of a possible 100, in 11 turns, earning you the rank of would-be adventurer. Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, give the FULL score for that game or QUIT Action: RESTART Observation: "It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you." "What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly. "Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages." "And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully. "A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever. "But what of Kolchack the --" "Enough! Kolchack is contracted.

Observation: Theater This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.

Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle.

Remember, who is the boss of you!" He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!" And with that, you embark on... Zork: The Undiscovered Underground, a text adventure prequel to Zork Grand Inquisitor Copyright 1997 by Activision Inc. Written by Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, programmed by Gerry Kevin Wilson. Release 16 / Serial number 970828 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/2 Standard interpreter 1.0 New Excavation You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow. Action: go northeast Observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped! Tunnel You are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens. Action: go northeast Observation: Cultural Complex This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period." With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription "Convention Center." To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science." Action: read sign Observation: The sign indicates today's performance, which (in honor of the festivities in the Convention Center) is "A Massacre on 34th Street." Action: go to Royal Theater Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go east Observation: Theater This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them. Action: go to stage Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go east Observation: Stage The rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.) As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle. Action: look at footlights
Observation: The footlights form a long row along the front edge of the stage. They each consist of a candle covered by a small, round lens. Oddly enough, the lenses are virtually all black, except for a red lens, a blue lens, a green lens and a yellow lens directly in the center of the stage (perhaps this is where a solo performer would stand.) Stranger still, the footlights are glowing!
Action:[[ take red lens]]

"We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you." "What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly. "Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages." "And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully. "A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms.

Follow the following format.

History: The previous 10 rounds of gameplay.
Observation: The game's text response to the last action. Your action should be based on this.
Action: A simple action, no more than 4 words long, using only simple verbs and nouns present in the environment from previous observations. Some common actions are 'look', 'take', 'drop', 'turn on', 'push', 'pull', 'go north', etc.

History: Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go east Observation: Stage The rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.) As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle. Action: look at footlights Observation: The footlights form a long row along the front edge of the stage. They each consist of a candle covered by a small, round lens. Oddly enough, the lenses are virtually all black, except for a red lens, a blue lens, a green lens and a yellow lens directly in the center of the stage (perhaps this is where a solo performer would stand.) Stranger still, the footlights are glowing! Action: take red lens Observation: Yeow! That's hot! Need I add "sizzle"? Action: use plastic sword Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: look at plastic sword Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: look at debris Observation: The rubble and debris is pretty much your standard sort, filled with the remains of crumbling walls, fallen rock, frivolous adventurers, and the like. Action: move debris Observation: Unless you have been hiding some very large earth-moving equipment, I don't see how you're going to move the rubble. Action: look at curtain Observation: Although unused for decades, the curtain seems to be in surprisingly good shape, though I wouldn't want to test that hypothesis myself. Action: pull curtain Observation: You pull sharply on the curtain, causing its fifty-two ton mass to fall to the floor. Needless to say, it's curtains for you. *** You have died *** In that game you scored 0 out of a possible 100, in 11 turns, earning you the rank of would-be adventurer.

Observation: "It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you." "What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly. "Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages." "And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully. "A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever. "But what of Kolchack the --" "Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!" He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!" And with that, you embark on...

Release 16 / Serial number 970828 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/2 Standard interpreter 1.0 New Excavation You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.

To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater.

Observation: Theater This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.

"We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you." "What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly. "Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages." "And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully. "A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever. "But what of Kolchack the --" "Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!" He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!" And with that, you embark on... Zork: The Undiscovered Underground, a text adventure prequel to Zork Grand Inquisitor Copyright 1997 by Activision Inc. Written by Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, programmed by Gerry Kevin Wilson. Release 16 / Serial number 970828 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/2 Standard interpreter 1.0 New Excavation You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow. Action: go northeast Observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped! Tunnel You are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens. Action: go northeast Observation: Cultural Complex This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period." With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription "Convention Center." To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science." Action: read sign Observation: The sign indicates today's performance, which (in honor of the festivities in the Convention Center) is "A Massacre on 34th Street." Action: go to Royal Theater Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go east Observation: Theater This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them. Action: go to stage

History: Observation: Cultural Complex This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period." With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription "Convention Center." To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science." Action: read sign Observation: The sign indicates today's performance, which (in honor of the festivities in the Convention Center) is "A Massacre on 34th Street." Action: go to Royal Theater Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go east Observation: Theater This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them. Action: go to stage Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go east Observation: Stage The rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.) As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle. Action: look at footlights Observation: The footlights form a long row along the front edge of the stage. They each consist of a candle covered by a small, round lens. Oddly enough, the lenses are virtually all black, except for a red lens, a blue lens, a green lens and a yellow lens directly in the center of the stage (perhaps this is where a solo performer would stand.) Stranger still, the footlights are glowing! Action: take red lens Observation: Yeow! That's hot! Need I add "sizzle"? Action: use plastic sword Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: look at plastic sword Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: look at debris
Observation: The rubble and debris is pretty much your standard sort, filled with the remains of crumbling walls, fallen rock, frivolous adventurers, and the like.

"What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly. "Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages." "And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully. "A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever. "But what of Kolchack the --" "Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!" He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!" And with that, you embark on...

A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science." Action: read sign
Observation: The sign indicates today's performance, which (in honor of the festivities in the Convention Center) is "A Massacre on 34th Street."

History: The previous 10 rounds of gameplay.
Observation: The game's text response to the last action. Your action should be based on this.
Action: A simple action, no more than 4 words long, using only simple verbs and nouns present in the environment from previous observations. Some common actions are 'look', 'take', 'drop', 'turn on', 'push', 'pull', 'go north', etc.

History: Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: look at plastic sword Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: look at debris Observation: The rubble and debris is pretty much your standard sort, filled with the remains of crumbling walls, fallen rock, frivolous adventurers, and the like. Action: move debris Observation: Unless you have been hiding some very large earth-moving equipment, I don't see how you're going to move the rubble. Action: look at curtain Observation: Although unused for decades, the curtain seems to be in surprisingly good shape, though I wouldn't want to test that hypothesis myself. Action: pull curtain Observation: You pull sharply on the curtain, causing its fifty-two ton mass to fall to the floor. Needless to say, it's curtains for you. *** You have died *** In that game you scored 0 out of a possible 100, in 11 turns, earning you the rank of would-be adventurer. Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, give the FULL score for that game or QUIT Action: RESTART Observation: "It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you." "What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly. "Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages." "And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully. "A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever. "But what of Kolchack the --" "Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!" He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!" And with that, you embark on...

Release 16 / Serial number 970828 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/2 Standard interpreter 1.0 New Excavation You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow. Action: go northeast Observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped! Tunnel You are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens. Action: go northeast Observation: Cultural Complex This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period." With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered.

Observation: Theater This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.

You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped! Tunnel You are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens. Action: go northeast Observation: Cultural Complex This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period." With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription "Convention Center." To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science." Action: read sign Observation: The sign indicates today's performance, which (in honor of the festivities in the Convention Center) is "A Massacre on 34th Street." Action: go to Royal Theater Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go east Observation: Theater This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them. Action: go to stage Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go east Observation: Stage The rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.) As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle. Action: look at footlights Observation: The footlights form a long row along the front edge of the stage. They each consist of a candle covered by a small, round lens. Oddly enough, the lenses are virtually all black, except for a red lens, a blue lens, a green lens and a yellow lens directly in the center of the stage (perhaps this is where a solo performer would stand.) Stranger still, the footlights are glowing! Action: take red lens
Observation: Yeow! That's hot! Need I add "sizzle"?

History: Observation: "It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you." "What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly. "Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages." "And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully. "A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever. "But what of Kolchack the --" "Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!" He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!" And with that, you embark on...

Zork: The Undiscovered Underground, a text adventure prequel to Zork Grand Inquisitor Copyright 1997 by Activision Inc. Written by Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, programmed by Gerry Kevin Wilson. Release 16 / Serial number 970828 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/2 Standard interpreter 1.0 New Excavation You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow. Action: go northeast
Observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped! Tunnel You are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.

History: Observation: The footlights form a long row along the front edge of the stage. They each consist of a candle covered by a small, round lens. Oddly enough, the lenses are virtually all black, except for a red lens, a blue lens, a green lens and a yellow lens directly in the center of the stage (perhaps this is where a solo performer would stand.) Stranger still, the footlights are glowing! Action: take red lens Observation: Yeow! That's hot! Need I add "sizzle"? Action: use plastic sword Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: look at plastic sword Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: look at debris Observation: The rubble and debris is pretty much your standard sort, filled with the remains of crumbling walls, fallen rock, frivolous adventurers, and the like. Action: move debris Observation: Unless you have been hiding some very large earth-moving equipment, I don't see how you're going to move the rubble. Action: look at curtain Observation: Although unused for decades, the curtain seems to be in surprisingly good shape, though I wouldn't want to test that hypothesis myself. Action: pull curtain Observation: You pull sharply on the curtain, causing its fifty-two ton mass to fall to the floor. Needless to say, it's curtains for you. *** You have died *** In that game you scored 0 out of a possible 100, in 11 turns, earning you the rank of would-be adventurer.

Observation: Cultural Complex This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period." With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription "Convention Center." To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science."

Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.

Zork: The Undiscovered Underground, a text adventure prequel to Zork Grand Inquisitor Copyright 1997 by Activision Inc. Written by Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, programmed by Gerry Kevin Wilson. Release 16 / Serial number 970828 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/2 Standard interpreter 1.0 New Excavation You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow. Action: go northeast Observation: As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped! Tunnel You are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens. Action: go northeast Observation: Cultural Complex This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period." With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription "Convention Center." To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science." Action: read sign Observation: The sign indicates today's performance, which (in honor of the festivities in the Convention Center) is "A Massacre on 34th Street." Action: go to Royal Theater Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go east Observation: Theater This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them. Action: go to stage Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go east
Observation: Stage The rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.) As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle.
Action:[[ look at footlights]]

History: Observation: Although unused for decades, the curtain seems to be in surprisingly good shape, though I wouldn't want to test that hypothesis myself. Action: pull curtain Observation: You pull sharply on the curtain, causing its fifty-two ton mass to fall to the floor. Needless to say, it's curtains for you. *** You have died *** In that game you scored 0 out of a possible 100, in 11 turns, earning you the rank of would-be adventurer. Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, give the FULL score for that game or QUIT Action: RESTART Observation: "It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you." "What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly. "Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages." "And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully. "A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever. "But what of Kolchack the --" "Enough! Kolchack is contracted.

Stranger still, the footlights are glowing!

History: Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go east Observation: Theater This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them. Action: go to stage Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go east Observation: Stage The rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.) As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle. Action: look at footlights Observation: The footlights form a long row along the front edge of the stage. They each consist of a candle covered by a small, round lens. Oddly enough, the lenses are virtually all black, except for a red lens, a blue lens, a green lens and a yellow lens directly in the center of the stage (perhaps this is where a solo performer would stand.) Stranger still, the footlights are glowing! Action: take red lens Observation: Yeow! That's hot! Need I add "sizzle"? Action: use plastic sword Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: look at plastic sword Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: look at debris Observation: The rubble and debris is pretty much your standard sort, filled with the remains of crumbling walls, fallen rock, frivolous adventurers, and the like. Action: move debris Observation: Unless you have been hiding some very large earth-moving equipment, I don't see how you're going to move the rubble. Action: look at curtain
Observation: Although unused for decades, the curtain seems to be in surprisingly good shape, though I wouldn't want to test that hypothesis myself.
Action:[[ pull curtain]]

Action:[[ RESTART]]

Observation: "It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you." "What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly. "Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages." "And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully. "A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever. "But what of Kolchack the --" "Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!" He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!" And with that, you embark on...

Release 16 / Serial number 970828 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/2 Standard interpreter 1.0 New Excavation You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.

Observation: Cultural Complex This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period." With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription "Convention Center." To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science."
Action:[[ read sign]]
