Action: "take egg" Observation: "No, no, no!" screams the egg in terror, clutching the fence post for dear life. "I'll fall and smash into a million pieces! Release me at once!" Startled, you let go. Action: "apologize to egg" Observation: "Well..." the egg hesitates. "No harm done, I suppose." Action: "ask egg about ledge" Observation: The egg coughs politely and looks away. Action: "ask egg about fence" Observation: With an embarrassed laugh, the egg admits, "Unfortunately, I've gotten myself into a spot of trouble. I am unable to descend from this fence without risking major injury." Action: "help egg down" Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to help. Action: "lift egg gently" Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to lift the egg. Action: "carefully remove egg" Observation: "I haven't the slightest idea what you're referring to," murmurs the egg. Action: "ask egg for help" Observation: "I'm afraid I must plead ignorance," the egg apologizes. Action: "examine fence"
Observation: Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice. Anyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new "Surfers Monthly" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening. Shyeah, right. That's what YOU think.
