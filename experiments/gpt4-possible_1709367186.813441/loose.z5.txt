What was that?

You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.

"No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind."

After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.

Rickety Fence
The ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other. Although it hasn't fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and if that egg isn't careful...

The footpath running along the fence veers sharply north.

The egg hums a little tune your mother used to sing at bedtime.

You're seven years old and in trouble a lot. You try to be good and to do as you ought, but nothing, it seems, goes exactly as planned. For instance, today things got quite out of hand: you poured your own milk, but it spilled on the floor; the cat wanted out just as you slammed the door; you didn't remember to turn off the faucet; your brother, poor thing, is still locked in the closet.

But that wasn't all. No, indeed. Did I mention that things got much worse? They did. Pay attention: you're lost and alone and nothing's familiar. You wander around for a while until you're ready to panic. Then, out of the blue, an egg on a fence asks for help--and from you!

"I'm afraid I must plead ignorance," the egg apologizes.
> "look around"
What do you want to look around?
> "look around area"
You can't see any such thing.
> "look at egg"
Although somewhat short and rotund, the egg takes obvious pride in his appearance, wearing neatly pressed dark slacks and a white, button-down shirt with the initials H.D. embroidered on the collar. His necktie is conservative, his shoes polished, his handkerchief clean and folded.

The egg wobbles ever so slightly on the narrow ledge of the fence.
> "talk to H.D."
You can't see any such thing.
> "talk to egg"
To talk to the egg, try this: "egg, do something"

> "egg, roll sideways"
"Pardon? I'm not quite certain what you meant."
> "push egg"
"No, no, no!" screams the egg in terror, clutching the fence post for dear life. "I'll fall and smash into a million pieces! Release me at once!" Startled, you let go.
> "comfort egg"
"Perhaps you would care to rephrase that," the egg suggests. "I'm not quite certain what you intended to say."
> "talk to egg"

Although somewhat short and rotund, the egg takes obvious pride in his appearance, wearing neatly pressed dark slacks and a white, button-down shirt with the initials H.D. embroidered on the collar. His necktie is conservative, his shoes polished, his handkerchief clean and folded.

The egg wobbles ever so slightly on the narrow ledge of the fence.

> "take egg"
"No, no, no!" screams the egg in terror, clutching the fence post for dear life. "I'll fall and smash into a million pieces! Release me at once!" Startled, you let go.
> "apologize to egg"
"Well..." the egg hesitates. "No harm done, I suppose."
> "ask egg about ledge"
The egg coughs politely and looks away.
> "ask egg about fence"
With an embarrassed laugh, the egg admits, "Unfortunately, I've gotten myself into a spot of trouble. I am unable to descend from this fence without risking major injury."
> "help egg down"
I only understood you as far as wanting to help.
> "lift egg gently"
I only understood you as far as wanting to lift the egg.
> "carefully remove egg"
"I haven't the slightest idea what you're referring to," murmurs the egg.
> "ask egg for help"
"I'm afraid I must plead ignorance," the egg apologizes.
> "examine fence"
The fence creaks ominously as a gust of wind swirls against it. When a ray of sunlight falls just so, a few of the boards show traces of graffiti. Someone has tried to scrub away the message, but you can see dribbles of paint where the spray can was held too close.
