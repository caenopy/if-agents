A beautiful day in Bostwin! You are awakened by a ray of sunlight peeking through a window shade and rise refreshed after a restful night's sleep.  You've given your Company a weekend pass to get some R&R after your last grueling mission.  Wasting precious little time your entire company took off for the city proper to pack in as much drinking, carousing, brawling, wenching and other relaxing pursuits as possible in 48 hours.  In the fields of battle your men are an elite unit of trained professionals.  Off-duty they're pretty much like every other bunch of soldiers you've ever served with. 

A weekend off and what to do? After the challenges of the past year when you were first promoted and assumed command of Charlie Company you've nearly forgotton what free time is and what you're supposed to do with it.

Your Quarters
Rank certainly does have its privileges.  When you were a lowly lieutenant you had to share cramped quarters with a fellow lieutenant at your previous assignment.  Commanding a company of your own affords you the luxury of private, spacious quarters just outside the barracks themselves. As a further abuse of your power your chest and bunk are not standard issue items from the Pentari millitary supply center.

Charlie Company Compound
Your company compound consists of three large buildings bordering a large, open area where company formations precede the orders of the day.  To the west the Company's supply building can be seen while directly ahead of you lies your company's barracks which seem quieter than a crypt.  Off to the east you hear the distant shouts of another Company drilling.  Poor souls.
> go to supply building
You can't see any such thing.
> go west
Why would you want to inspect the Company's supply cache when you have a whole weekend off?
> go east
It's considered a breach of protocol to enter the compound of another company while training.  You wisely decide to not step on any toes this time.

Charlie Company Barracks
If the Army of Bostwin were to publish a new edition of the soldier's handbook, a picture of this barracks should be included as the example other companies should follow.  The floors are polished to an almost blinding shine while each of the bunks lining both sides of this building are perfectly made.  Every locker next to each bunk is closed and locked. Not a single scrap of paper, not one article of clothing, nay not even a dust particle looks out of place.  The powerful smell of high quantities of pine cleaner nearly burns your nostrils. Damn, you run a good comapny.

You can see a Pentarian Transporter here.

These are ordinary metallic lockers, painted an olive green.
> open locker

> look at bunks
Your typical millitary issue bunk beds; stacked two high to save on space and of a solid metal frame.  The company's bunks are made so well you could bounce quarters, daggers, paperweights, small animals, etc. off of them.
> search bunks
You find nothing of interest.

One of the many wonders the Wizards of Pentari have developed is the transporter.  The older, time-consuming methods of travel have been obviated by this elegantly simple device which can send the traveller over any distance in mere seconds simpy by stating your destination after entering the booth.

As you are in an Army barracks and not a five star hotel this is one of the simplest models available.  It's nothing more than a three sided booth
pre-programmed to a single destination.  A sign directly over the booth bears the simple legend 'City Transporter' over it.
