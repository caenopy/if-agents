Observation: This has never been your favorite part of the city. Nor is this neighborhood the safest one. But as a city sanitarian, you are charged with completing an annual health and safety inspection of every restaurant in your district. Each day you visit three or four restaurants. During those visits you take note of potential health code violations in your trusty notepad. Today's first target: Nikolai's Bar and Grill. A hazy sun barely peeks above the three-story tenements. Afflicted An Interactive Fiction by Doug Egan Release 1 / Serial number 080906 / Inform 7 build 5T18 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) Type "About" at any time to see game instructions and other notes from the author. 19th Street You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street. A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room. The front entrance is north of you. The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of crabgrass. A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with broken bottles. Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically. A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak. An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door. A damp sheet of newspaper has blown up against the curb.
Action:[[ "read placard"]]
