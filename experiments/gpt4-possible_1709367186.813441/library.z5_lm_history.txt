History: Observation: << Outside >> You are outside. it's bitter cold and you pull your jacket around yourself. To the north is a nice, warm Holiday Inn hotel, where the killer is rumoured to be staying. Or you could go to his favourite hang out, the Wall, to the west, or to the east is the place where he is supposed to be working, the Doughnut King. [Your score has just gone up by ten points.] Action: go north Observation: << Holiday Inn >> You are in the Holiday Inn registration room. You talk to some suspicious guys, but they don't talk until you hold your gun to their side. "Alright! Alright! I'll talk! He's on the 15th floor! That's all I can tell ya!" You shove them away. You walk up to the registration desk and show the woman there your badge. She gives you the master ring. You now have access to all of the facilitys on the 15th floor. But the problem is that the 15th floor is the suite level, and there are 30 suites, and 5 pools, 2 saunas and 5 game rooms. Big problem! Well, you have all night. You get a picture of all on the 15th floor, the people up there have to show their drivers license to be admitted, and the license is secretly xeroxed. You look at them all. Well, better get started. You see one person who stands out. You get his room number from the lady. Room 30. Now you have to find it. To get started, go north. [Your score has just gone up by ten points.] Action: go north Observation: << Holiday Inn 15th Floor >> You go up the elevator. When you step out, you see the wallpaper is pink, with little flowers on it. You can go east or west.

You can only go north. [Your score has just gone up by ten points.] Action: go north Observation: << Hallway >> You are still in the hallways. You can go west or east. [Your score has just gone up by ten points.] Action: go west Observation: << Hallway >> You are in the hallway.

[Your score has just gone up by one hundred points.] Action: go up
Observation: ALL QUIET ON THE LIBRARY FRONT [Please press SPACE to begin.] Every library should try to be complete on something, if it were only the history of pinheads. -- Oliver Wendell Holmes, The Poet at the Breakfast-Table You are a student at Anycollege, in Anytown, and it's the end of the semester! You've been slacking off all semester long, and it's catching up to you. That final paper is due for your Computer Science class ("The History of IF Games"), and you desperately need to check out a comprehensive book on Graham Nelson, one of the foremost authors of the obscure genre of interactive-fiction. You know there is exactly one such book, but you have no idea where it might be! The first time player should probably type "help". ALL QUIET ON THE LIBRARY FRONT An Interactive Vignette Release 2 / Serial number 951204 / Inform v1502 Library 5/12 Standard interpreter 1.0 Lobby This is the entrance to the library. The circulation desk dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of desks and tables. A pair of security gates stands before the front doors to prevent people from stealing books. A card catalog lurks in a dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh flourescent light. Glass doors to the west lead to the book stacks; an archway to the northwest is labelled "Duplicating Services"; a door to the north bears a sign marked "Private" in large friendly letters; and the exit is to the east You can see a circulation desk attendant here.
Action:[[ talk to attendant]]

Action: ask librarian about key Observation: "The key may be obtained at the circulation desk." Action: go to circulation desk Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go east Observation: Lobby This is the entrance to the library. The circulation desk dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of desks and tables. A pair of security gates stands before the front doors to prevent people from stealing books. A card catalog lurks in a dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh flourescent light. Glass doors to the west lead to the book stacks; an archway to the northwest is labelled "Duplicating Services"; a door to the north bears a sign marked "Private" in large friendly letters; and the exit is to the east You can see a circulation desk attendant here. Action: ask attendant for key Observation: The circulation desk attendant has better things to do. Action: ask attendant about key Observation: "You need to give me your ID card in order to get the key to the Rare Books Room." Action: give ID to attendant Observation: The circulation attendant gives you the key to the Rare Books Room, and he holds your ID card in exchange. [Your score has just gone up by five points.] Action: go north Observation: Perhaps you should examine the sign first. Action: examine sign Observation: The sign on the northern door says "Private" in large friendly letters, the same kind of lettering which is usually seen on signs saying "Attack-Trained Rottweilers Patrolling Premises After Business Hours". Action: go west
Observation: You push the glass doors open. Their hydraulics hiss faintly. Ground Floor Stacks This cavernous room is lit with flickering flourescent lighting which makes the ceiling look even lower than it really is. It is filled with half-empty shelves, upon which rest the dusty boxes of many early games. To one side sits a massive, ancient desk, its surface cluttered with paperwork. A sign on the wall indicates that this is the reference desk, which would make the prim young woman sitting behind it the reference librarian. A doorway to the north is labelled "Stairs", and glass doors lead east to the lobby. You can see a reference librarian here.
Action:[[ go north]]

History: Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: go up stairs Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to go the ceiling. Action: go up Observation: Second Floor Stairwell Grungy stairs lead downwards. The lights are dim, and a painting hangs on the wall. A door to the south appears to open into a room of shelves. Action: go south Observation: Second Floor Stacks You are in a maze of twisty shelves, all alike. (Well, okay, not really) This cavernous room is filled with shelves as far as the eye can see. A doorway to the east is labelled "Computer Room", and the stairwell lies to the north. A heavy wooden door bars the way to the rare books room. A sign indicates that the key may be obtained from the circulation desk. Action: use key on door Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Action: talk to technician Observation: That's not a verb I recognise. Action: speak to technician
Observation: I didn't understand that sentence.
