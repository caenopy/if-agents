Sleeping Room
Most of the time when you are in here it is dark and quiet because that is the best way to sleep and this is the room made for sleeping. There is a high bed here that is not your bed although it is where you sleep usually to keep your pet company. The sitting room is south of here and the room with the water is to the west.

Your low bed is here, looking all soft and cushy.

Dino is here! Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off dino], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[look in high], InteractiveFictionGame[south]
> look in high
You stick your head under the bed for a closer look and discover... a sock! Your pet has probably been looking for this, since socks usually stick together. You wonder why this one ran away.

You love on your pet with some little licks.

> push pet
You tuck your head up under your pet and push back and forth to shake him.

> push pet
You tuck your head up under your pet and push back and forth to shake him.

Hmm, your pet seems to have turned that into part of his dream or something, because he sure didn't move this time when you shook him. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[pull pet], InteractiveFictionGame[take off sock], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west]
> pull pet
You carefully use your teeth to get a hold of your pet's arm and pull it towards you.

Your pet shifts and stretches, blinking. He moves around until he is mostly sitting up.

"Hey Hardy," he mumbles.

It might take a little more to get him up and moving, but at least now his eyes are open!

Water Room
This is the room with a lot of water. There's water that sits in a bowl and there's water that falls from up high to fill up a bigger bowl and lots of times when your pet is in here you hear the sounds of water. 

This room would be more fun if you liked water more. Anyway, you like the sleeping room to the east much better. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[examine bigger], InteractiveFictionGame[take inventory], InteractiveFictionGame[take off bigger], InteractiveFictionGame[east]
> examine bigger
It's a big old bowl that holds a lot of water. Sometimes your pet maneuvers you into it and makes you all foamy and wet and then you have to shake off the water and roll around outside a lot before you smell right again.

(As you open your mouth, you drop the dino.)
