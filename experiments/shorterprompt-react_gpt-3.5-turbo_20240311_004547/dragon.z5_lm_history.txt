You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Input: An instruction to play the game.

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I should start by exploring my surroundings and looking for any clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around]

Observation 1: I only understood you as far as wanting to look. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[yes], InteractiveFictionGame[rescue], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Thought 2: I need to choose a valid action from the list provided. Let's try to move in a direction to explore more of the game world.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 2:
Rocky Mountains
It is a clear, bright morning and all seems peaceful. A tiny sparrowhawk wheels and soars lazily in the cool empty air above. There is a steep pathway to the south leading down into dense woodland, and you can make out an old building by the path. In the distance you can just glimpse the steel-grey of the sea, far away to the west. 

You can go north, south, east or west. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[yes], InteractiveFictionGame[rescue], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Thought 3: I should continue exploring the area and see if I can find any items or clues that might help me progress in the game.

Thought 5: I should try exploring a different direction again since going north didn't provide any new information. Let's try going south this time.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation 5:
Abandoned Inn
An old, thatched building stands near the path. It seems to be an abandoned inn or tavern, as a faded sign reads 'Troll's Arms'. The walls are a dirty white and the paintwork is starting to peel and blister. The windows are covered in cobwebs and there is the faint odour of mildew and decay. Weeds grow between the flagstones of the path leading up to the door, which leans open. No-one seems to have lived here for years. A path leads north into the mountains and there seems to be some swampy ground to the west. 

You can go north (to the mountains), west (towards a swamp) or east (into the inn). Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[yes], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[rescue], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 6: I should explore the abandoned inn to see if there are any items or clues inside that could help me progress in the game.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 6:
Inside the Inn
There are a few patches of mould on the walls and the floorboards creak slightly, but the building seems safe enough. As you move you disturb a thin layer of dust. There are some stone steps leading down, and an open doorway to the outside to the west. You see some tables and chairs. There is a dark, intricately-carved wooden chair in the corner behind you. 

You can go west (back outside) or down some steps.

You can see a magnificently carved chair here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[yes], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[rescue], InteractiveFictionGame[get in sofa], InteractiveFictionGame[get in chair], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[push chair to table], InteractiveFictionGame[push chair to sofa]

Thought 7: I should investigate the magnificently carved chair to see if there's anything hidden in or around it that could be useful.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[get in chair]

Observation 7: You get onto the magnificently carved chair. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[yes], InteractiveFictionGame[get up], InteractiveFictionGame[rescue]

Thought 8: I should try getting up from the chair to see if there's anything else in the room that I can interact with.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[get up]

Thought 9: I should try exploring the area further and see if there are any other items or clues that could help me progress in the game.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[down]

Observation 9:
Inn Cellar
The cellar seems to have been formed from a natural cavern in the rock under the inn, which has been smoothed and extended to form a storage area for the sorts of things inns need to keep - casks and bottles and the like, which will remain cool in the slightly chill air. There are the remains of some old barrels, but almost everything else seems to have been removed from here long ago. Dim daylight filters down the open stairwell from the inn above, where there is a flight of steep stone steps. By the far west wall stand thick stalagmites which rise out of the floor like dragon's teeth, behind which is a dark opening. It might be your imagination, but you think you can just catch an occasional dry, rustling sound coming from deep inside the darkness. The uneven floor is covered in dust, and at first glance you see no signs of life apart from your own boot-prints. 

You can go up (to the inn) or west (into the dark tunnel).

You can see an ancient silver coin and some barrels here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[get up], InteractiveFictionGame[rescue], InteractiveFictionGame[take coin], InteractiveFictionGame[examine barrels], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[spend coin], InteractiveFictionGame[throw coin down]

Action 14: InteractiveFictionGame[fill mug]

Observation 14: OK... you fill the mug with water from the lake. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[yes], InteractiveFictionGame[rescue], InteractiveFictionGame[put mug down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all in mug], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Thought 15: I should try to find a way to illuminate the darkness so I can see where I'm going. Let's try using the water-filled pewter mug to create some light.

Action 19: InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Observation 19:
You can't really see where you're going...
Darkness
It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[yes], InteractiveFictionGame[rescue], InteractiveFictionGame[put mug down], InteractiveFictionGame[empty mug out], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Thought 20: It seems the attempt to create light with the water-filled pewter mug and ancient silver coin didn't work. I should try a different approach to illuminate the darkness. Let's go back and explore other areas to find a solution.

Action 20: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 20: You can't go that way. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[yes], InteractiveFictionGame[rescue], InteractiveFictionGame[put mug down], InteractiveFictionGame[empty mug out], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Action 21: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 21:
The Dragon suddenly attacks you... 
(apparently, dragons can see quite well in the dark!) 
You have just been lightly fried by the Dragon, but you magically return back to life for another go... 
(You still have a bit of a headache, though...)

Flames
You did something slightly fatal... 

You can see a way out to the south...

[Your score has just gone down by two points.] Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[rescue], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation 22:
Rocky Mountains
It is a clear, bright morning and all seems peaceful. A tiny sparrowhawk wheels and soars lazily in the cool empty air above.

In the distance you can just glimpse the steel-grey of the sea, far away to the west. 

You can go north, south, east or west.

Thought 44: It seems I'm still stuck in the darkness. I should try a different approach to find a solution. Let's go back and explore other areas to see if there's anything else that could help me progress in the game.

Action 44: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 44:
Inn Cellar
The cellar seems to have been formed from a natural cavern in the rock under the inn, which has been smoothed and extended to form a storage area for the sorts of things inns need to keep - casks and bottles and the like, which will remain cool in the slightly chill air. There are the remains of some old barrels, but almost everything else seems to have been removed from here long ago. Dim daylight filters down the open stairwell from the inn above, where there is a flight of steep stone steps. By the far west wall stand thick stalagmites which rise out of the floor like dragon's teeth, behind which is a dark opening. It might be your imagination, but you think you can just catch an occasional dry, rustling sound coming from deep inside the darkness. The uneven floor is covered in dust, and at first glance you see no signs of life apart from your own boot-prints. 

You can go up (to the inn) or west (into the dark tunnel).

You can see some barrels (which are empty) here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[put bones down], InteractiveFictionGame[get up], InteractiveFictionGame[rescue], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[put bones in barrels]

Thought 45: I should try exploring the dark tunnel again with a different approach to illuminate the darkness. Let's see if there's anything else in the cellar that could help me with this.
