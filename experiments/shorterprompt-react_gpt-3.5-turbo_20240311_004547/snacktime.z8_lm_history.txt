You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Input: An instruction to play the game.

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I should start by exploring my surroundings and looking for any clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around]

Observation 1: I only understood you as far as wanting to look. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[push pet], InteractiveFictionGame[kiss on pet], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Thought 2: I need to choose a valid action from the list provided. Since I don't see any relevant actions related to exploring or searching for clues, I'll try going north to see if there are any items or clues in that direction.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 2:
Sleeping Room
Most of the time when you are in here it is dark and quiet because that is the best way to sleep and this is the room made for sleeping. There is a high bed here that is not your bed although it is where you sleep usually to keep your pet company. The sitting room is south of here and the room with the water is to the west.

Your low bed is here, looking all soft and cushy.

Dino is here! Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off dino], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[look in high], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Thought 3: I should search the high bed for any clues or items that could be useful.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[look in high]

Observation 3: You stick your head under the bed for a closer look and discover... a sock! Your pet has probably been looking for this, since socks usually stick together. You wonder why this one ran away. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off dino], InteractiveFictionGame[take off sock], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[take all], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Thought 4: I should take the sock since it might be useful later on in the game.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[take off sock]

Observation 4: You're not wearing that. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[examine west], InteractiveFictionGame[take inventory], InteractiveFictionGame[take off room], InteractiveFictionGame[take off dino], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Thought 5: I should check my inventory to see what items I have collected so far.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[take inventory]

Observation 5: Held carefully between your teeth is a sock. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[examine west], InteractiveFictionGame[take inventory], InteractiveFictionGame[take off room], InteractiveFictionGame[take off dino], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Thought 6: I should continue exploring the room and see if there are any other items or clues that could help me progress in the game.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[examine west]

Observation 6: You see nothing unexpected in that direction. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[examine west], InteractiveFictionGame[take inventory], InteractiveFictionGame[take off room], InteractiveFictionGame[take off dino], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Thought 7: Since there doesn't seem to be anything of interest in the west direction, I should try exploring the south direction to see if there are any more clues or items.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation 7:
Sitting Room
Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[examine box], InteractiveFictionGame[take inventory], InteractiveFictionGame[push pet], InteractiveFictionGame[pull pet], InteractiveFictionGame[take off box], InteractiveFictionGame[kiss on pet], InteractiveFictionGame[put sock on long], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Thought 8: I should interact with the pet and see if it reacts to the sock I found earlier.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[put sock on long]

Observation 8: You put the sock on the long soft thing. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[push pet], InteractiveFictionGame[take off sock], InteractiveFictionGame[kiss on pet], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Thought 9: I should try interacting with the pet now that I've put the sock on the long soft thing.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[kiss on pet]

Observation 9:
You love on your pet with some little licks.

Your pet twitches a little and stirs, then is still again. It's a start at waking him up. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[push pet], InteractiveFictionGame[take off sock], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Thought 10: I should continue trying to wake up the pet by interacting with it further.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[push pet]

Observation 10:
You tuck your head up under your pet and push back and forth to shake him.

Your pet gets one eye open and half-heartedly pets at you. You're making progress. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[pull pet], InteractiveFictionGame[take off sock], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Thought 11: I should keep pushing the pet to fully wake it up.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[push pet]

Observation 11:
You tuck your head up under your pet and push back and forth to shake him.

Hmm, your pet seems to have turned that into part of his dream or something, because he sure didn't move this time when you shook him. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[pull pet], InteractiveFictionGame[take off sock], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Thought 12: I should try a different action to wake up the pet since pushing doesn't seem to be working.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[pull pet]

Observation 12:
You carefully use your teeth to get a hold of your pet's arm and pull it towards you.

Your pet shifts and stretches, blinking. He moves around until he is mostly sitting up.

"Hey Hardy," he mumbles.

It might take a little more to get him up and moving, but at least now his eyes are open!

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.] Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[get in long], InteractiveFictionGame[take off sock], InteractiveFictionGame[look in long], InteractiveFictionGame[give pet sock], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Thought 13: I should try to give the pet the sock to see if that helps wake him up fully.

Action 13: InteractiveFictionGame[give pet sock]

Observation 13: Your pet takes the sock from you and looks at it. "Thanks, Hardy," he says, before dropping it. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[get in all], InteractiveFictionGame[take off sock], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Thought 14: Since giving the pet the sock didn't fully wake him up, I should try a different action to continue progressing in the game.

Action 14: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 14:
Sleeping Room
Your low bed is here, looking all soft and cushy.

Water Room
This is the room with a lot of water. There's water that sits in a bowl and there's water that falls from up high to fill up a bigger bowl and lots of times when your pet is in here you hear the sounds of water. 

This room would be more fun if you liked water more. Anyway, you like the sleeping room to the east much better. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[examine bigger], InteractiveFictionGame[take inventory], InteractiveFictionGame[take off bigger], InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Thought 17: I should examine the bigger bowl of water to see if there are any clues or items hidden within it.
