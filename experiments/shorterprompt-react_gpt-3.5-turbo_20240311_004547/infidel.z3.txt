Your Tent
(You are in the army cot.)
You are in your tent. Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little.
At the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off cot], InteractiveFictionGame[look up wall]

You push yourself up and manage to get out of the cot. Your legs are a little wobbly, though, and your head swims.

Outside Your Tent
You are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. To the south you can see a firepit and to the north is the entrance to your tent. Everything is oddly quiet, unsettling, creating a feeling of floating anxiety. The stillness seems to enhance the eerie quality of the desert, the feeling of being truly alone. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

The plane seems to be circling right overhead. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[northeast], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]

Fire Pit
You are in the center of the encampment, standing before a charred pit, a hole dug in the sand surrounded by blackened rocks. The night breezes have already started the reclamation work of the desert, covering most of the pit's bottom. You can see your tent to the north, the work tent to the south, and the supply tent to the west. Far off to the east, through the heat waves rising off the shifting sands, you can see gentle, rolling dunes. There's an enlarged hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.
Half covered with sand is a bright piece of foil which catches your eye.
Sitting by a rock is what looks like a matchbook.

Taken.

You look up to see a small speck appear right beneath the plane -- probably a parachute. The plane heads off far to the northwest, dipping its wings in a salute.
