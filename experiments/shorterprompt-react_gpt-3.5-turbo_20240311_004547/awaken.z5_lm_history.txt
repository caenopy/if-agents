You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Input: An instruction to play the game.

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Observation 2:
As you scramble out of the hole the mud collapses downward, filling in the hole behind you.

Graveyard
Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The only exit is through the gate to the east.

A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the graveyard.

A large branch has been broken from one of the trees and has crushed the grave marker below it.

Observation 3:
West Side of the Church
This side of the church is untended and grasses and weeds have run rampant. A muddy trail leads back to the graveyard to the west and on to the southeast and a faint path continues around the church to the northeast.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 4:
North Side of the Church
The trees close in here, their storm-tossed branches seeming to reach clawing limbs towards the back of the church. The weeds have run wild here and ivy climbs its way up the back of the building.  A faint path continues around the church to the southeast and the southwest.

The south wall of the church looms blankly overhead.

This wide, graveled clearing may have once been where the worshippers at the church left their vehicles while attending services inside. If so, it seems that the last service was held long ago.
