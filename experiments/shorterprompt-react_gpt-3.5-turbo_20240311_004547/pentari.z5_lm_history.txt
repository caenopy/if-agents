Observation 3:
Charlie Company Compound
Your company compound consists of three large buildings bordering a large, open area where company formations precede the orders of the day.  To the west the Company's supply building can be seen while directly ahead of you lies your company's barracks which seem quieter than a crypt.

Action 17: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 17:
Charlie Company Barracks
If the Army of Bostwin were to publish a new edition of the soldier's handbook, a picture of this barracks should be included as the example other companies should follow.  The floors are polished to an almost blinding shine while each of the bunks lining both sides of this building are perfectly made.  Every locker next to each bunk is closed and locked. Not a single scrap of paper, not one article of clothing, nay not even a dust particle looks out of place.  The powerful smell of high quantities of pine cleaner nearly burns your nostrils. Damn, you run a good comapny.

You can see a Pentarian Transporter here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[enter], InteractiveFictionGame[get in transporter], InteractiveFictionGame[put postcard down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Action 19: InteractiveFictionGame[city]

Observation 19:
Your vision swims as your sight of the barracks blurs into a myriad of chaotic colors. You feel a moment of disorientation...

As you begin to materialize your eyes grow wide as you realize you're not in front of the Bank of Bostwin, where the transporter usually takes you in the city.  You're not even outdoors, you're indoors! What the hell is going on here...?

Entrance Hall
Your footsteps echo loudly as you walk through this room taking in the vast expanse of its size.  The walls rise majestically upward and outward to form a huge room which, curiously, is empty.  You can't help but wonder why such a large room is needed for the straight-forward task of accepting guests and visitors. To the east a wide open arch leads to what must be a library while to the north you hardly help but notice a huge, semi-circular marble staircase leading up to parts unknown.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.] Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put postcard down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down]

Observation 20: That's not a verb I recognise. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put postcard down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down]

Thought 21: I should try going north to see where the huge, semi-circular marble staircase leads and if there are any more clues or items there.

Action 21: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 21:
Main Hall
As you enter this great hall you can sense power and majesty.  The ceiling extends far above you while the walls stretch out seemingly for miles. From the entrance hall this room seemed somehow smaller than it actually is. Despite the availability of real estate in this room it's sparsely furnished.  A couple of comfortable chairs are tossed about almost haphazzardly in various corners.
A huge marble staircase winds upstairs to parts unknown while large archways lead east and west.

You can see a fine scroll here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take scroll], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put postcard down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation 22: Taken. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[luminus], InteractiveFictionGame[put postcard down], InteractiveFictionGame[put scroll down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Thought 23: I should try going east to explore that area and see if there are any more clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action 23: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 23: You bounce off an invisible barrier and hear a slightly annoyed voice from the south shouting "There's no time for this! Come to the library, Captain!" Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[luminus], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put postcard down], InteractiveFictionGame[put scroll down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Thought 24: I should go south to the library as instructed and see what awaits me there.

Observation 24: Entrance Hall Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[luminus], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put postcard down], InteractiveFictionGame[put scroll down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down]

Thought 25: I should try using the 'luminus' action to see if it helps me navigate through the library.

Action 25: InteractiveFictionGame[luminus]

Observation 25: As you invoke the magic imbued in the scroll it does a cursory inspection of your inventory and decides to turn an item in your inventory into something one might see in a futuristic science fiction movie; your sword is now a perfectly useful source of light among it's other inherent uses.  Unfortunately, the light is excessively bright; you're forced to squint for the pain to your eyes Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put postcard down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down]

Thought 26: I should try going east to explore that area and see if there are any more clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action 26: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 26:
Library
This is a vast chamber lined floor to ceiling with bookcases filled to capacity with books.  You haven't seen such a collection of knowledge since your academy days.  A cursory glance at some bookshelves reveal several titles on various topics of magic, history, philosophy, science and a hundred other topics.  A few large tables with chairs are in the center of the room inviting anyone to make use of these impressive facilities.

The wizard Morden is here staring at you, the smallest of smiles on his face.

You can also see a copy of The Legends and Lore of Pentari here.

Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[covert], InteractiveFictionGame[take other], InteractiveFictionGame[put postcard down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[push other to floor], InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Action 28: InteractiveFictionGame[covert]

Observation 28:
Spots in all the colors of the rainbow dance in front of your eyes as you feel yourself displaced...


You find yourself in the deep recesses of Vamvevmew's castle and instantly a wave of fear and depression hit you as hard as any enemy ever has.  Your hand shoots right for your sword in its scabbard on reflex and you grip the hilt so hard your knuckles whiten.

Castle
You are at the center of an intersection which runs east to west as well as north to south.

The Dark Elf walks in. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[put postcard down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Thought 29: I should try going north to see where that path leads and if there are any clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action 29: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 29:
Main Hall
This once majestic room was where visitors would come to relax and meet with the formal lord of the castle in a somewhat informal atmosphere. Several large comfortable couches are scattered about, dusty and altogether squalid.  Many large tapestries still hang on the walls but are horribly faded from age.  Large open archways lead east and west while a huge fireplace dominates the center of the room against the northern wall.

Action 30: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 30:
Spiral Stairway
A large spiral staircase made entirely of marble polished smooth corkscrews up to a second floor and down to murky depths below.

Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[get in floor], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[put postcard down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 31: I should try going up the spiral staircase to see where it leads and if there are any more clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action 31: InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Observation 31:
Castle, Upper Level
Looking around this large room you are astonished to learn that someone gutted this entire floor.  You are looking out on one, huge room.  No other rooms, no walls of any kind apart from the ones enclosing this gigantic area just nothing but empty room as far as you can see.

In the center of the floor a circle perhaps 30 feet in diameter is outlined in the floor with ash.  The inside of the circle is ringed with many odd symbols you can't begin to identify.  The acrid smell of something burning assaults your nostrils.

A box made of solid platinum is sitting on the floor here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[get in floor], InteractiveFictionGame[put postcard down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[open box], InteractiveFictionGame[put postcard on box], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword on box], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on box]

Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[close box], InteractiveFictionGame[get in floor], InteractiveFictionGame[put postcard down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[put postcard in box], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword in box], InteractiveFictionGame[put postcard on box], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword on box], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on box], InteractiveFictionGame[put all in box]

Thought 34: I should try putting all my items in the platinum box to see if that triggers any new events or progress in the game.

Action 34: InteractiveFictionGame[put all in box]

Observation 34:
postcard: Done.
fine Pentarian sword: Done. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take postcard], InteractiveFictionGame[take sword], InteractiveFictionGame[close box], InteractiveFictionGame[get in floor], InteractiveFictionGame[empty box], InteractiveFictionGame[take all off box], InteractiveFictionGame[push postcard to box], InteractiveFictionGame[push postcard to floor], InteractiveFictionGame[push sword to box], InteractiveFictionGame[push sword to floor]
