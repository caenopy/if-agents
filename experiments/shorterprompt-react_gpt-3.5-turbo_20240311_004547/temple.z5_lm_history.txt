You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Input: An instruction to play the game.

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I should start by exploring my surroundings and looking for any clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around]

Observation 1: I only understood you as far as wanting to look. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 2: I should try moving north to see what is in that direction.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 2:
You move, or rather you come to a new place. The concept of body and movement seems different here.

Void
This new location is not much different from the one you came from. The shadows are still moving around at random through the abyss, reverberating with strange sounds and coloured light.

A cascade of red colour explodes below you. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 3: I should continue moving north to see if I can find anything of interest in this strange location.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 3:
Void
This new location is not much different from the one you came from. The shadows are still moving around at random through the abyss, reverberating with strange sounds and coloured light.

Suddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[examine shadow], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 4: I should try to examine the shadow to see if it reveals any clues or information that could help me understand this new element in my dream.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[examine shadow]

Observation 4:
In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.

The shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.

Roof
The city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star-filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take railing], InteractiveFictionGame[down]

Thought 5: I should try to take the railing as it might be useful later on in the game.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[take railing]

Observation 5: The railing won't budge, but one of the statues breaks of in your hands. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue down]

Thought 6: I should try to put the statue down before proceeding further.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[put statue down]

Observation 6: Dropped. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take statue], InteractiveFictionGame[down]

Thought 7: I should try to take the statue back before moving down the staircase.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[take statue]

Observation 7: Taken. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue down]

Thought 8: I should now proceed to go down the staircase and explore what lies below.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[down]

Observation 8:
The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.

Study
Dust and spider webs cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam, blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic, dreamy forms. The walls are lined with bookshelves and a lone desk lies at one corner. Close to a staircase, which leads further up and down the tower, is a massive table made of black stone. A doorway leads to a smaller room to the south.

On the desk is a yellow paper. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[examine writing], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue down], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on table], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on dust], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on desk], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on ink], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on bookshelves], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 9: I should start by examining the yellow paper on the desk to see if it provides any important information or clues.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[examine writing]

Observation 9:
It seems to be a poem, or chant. The language is unfamiliar and complicated, and you repeat the syllables with a low voice: Y'ai'ng'ngah h'ee-l'geb f'ai throdog.

Even as you speak you sense something approaching. The light in the room darkens, and a mysterious green glow is emitted from some dust on the stone table. Its brightness intensifies to an unbearable level and you involuntarily step away. A shape appears on the previously empty table. As the flash fades away you recognise the shape as that of a man, lying still on the table.

Thought 10: I should try to touch the body on the table to see if it triggers any new events or reveals more information.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[touch body]

Observation 10: After several attempts, you manage to shake the man awake. He sits up on the table, still confused. In response to your many questions the man simply states that he can't remember and it seems that he is suffering from amnesia. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[examine tower], InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue down], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on desk], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on webs], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on bookshelves], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on table], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on ink], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 11: I should try to examine the tower to see if there are any clues or information that could help me understand the situation better.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[examine tower]

Observation 11:
Judging from the masonry the tower must be centuries old. It towers high above the nightmarish city below.

The man gets up from the table and looks around, perplexed. 'I think I've been here before', he mutters.

Thought 13: I should try to put the paper down on the table before deciding on the next action.

Action 13: InteractiveFictionGame[put paper on table]

Observation 13:
You put the yellow paper on the black stone table.

The man falls silent for a while, and then he says: 'Some parts of my memory have come back now. I remember that my name is Charles Bristow and I studied archeology and history in New England. Something terrible happened but of that I can recall only small fragments.' He looks around the chamber and says with despair in his voice, 'My God, where am I? Will my nightmares never end?' Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue down], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on desk], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on webs], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on bookshelves], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on table], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on ink], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 15: I should try to reassure Charles verbally instead of using a specific action in the game.

Action 15: InteractiveFictionGame[say to Charles: We will find a way out of this together]

Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue down], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on desk], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on webs], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on bookshelves], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on table], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue on ink], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Thought 16: I should try to focus on finding a way to progress in the game and help Charles remember more about his situation.

Action 16: InteractiveFictionGame[examine table]

Observation 16:
The base of the stone table is covered with carvings, each showing different kinds of creatures, or maybe Gods, standing on stone tables. Humans, who seem to be reciting prayers or spells, are standing in front of the creatures.
