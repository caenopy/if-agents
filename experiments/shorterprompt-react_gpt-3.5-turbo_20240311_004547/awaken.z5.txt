As you scramble out of the hole the mud collapses downward, filling in the hole behind you.

Graveyard
Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The only exit is through the gate to the east.

A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the graveyard.

A large branch has been broken from one of the trees and has crushed the grave marker below it.

West Side of the Church
This side of the church is untended and grasses and weeds have run rampant. A muddy trail leads back to the graveyard to the west and on to the southeast and a faint path continues around the church to the northeast.

To the east, the wall of the church breaks some of the force of the wind.

North Side of the Church
The trees close in here, their storm-tossed branches seeming to reach clawing limbs towards the back of the church. The weeds have run wild here and ivy climbs its way up the back of the building.  A faint path continues around the church to the southeast and the southwest.

The south wall of the church looms blankly overhead.

Lightning arcs overhead, followed instantly by a blast of thunder.

East Side of the Church
This wide, graveled clearing may have once been where the worshippers at the church left their vehicles while attending services inside. If so, it seems that the last service was held long ago. Weeds and grasses grow up through the gravel, which is littered with debris. Dark, looming trees surround the clearing except for the driveway, which leads to the southwest, and for a narrow opening to the northwest.

To the west, the church stares out over the clearing.
