Observation 8:
Shadow Armory
Shadows gather around you. For a moment, dregs of light defined by the negative space take on the shapes of maple leaf, kite, comb, and other shapes that flicker across the walls too rapidly for you to interpret.

Curiously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.

Undying Garden
Barren branches and pines suggest winter's quiet. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.

A jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, between translucence and opacity, curve and line, and other dichotomies too subtle for your eye. A gentle warmth from the surface invites touch.

Transactions of light show other rooms southward and westward.

You can see a tortoise-shell comb here.

Observation 38:
Shadow Armory
Curiously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.

Action 39: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 39:
Undying Garden
Summer's heady blooms are much in evidence. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.

A jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, between translucence and opacity, curve and line, and other dichotomies too subtle for your eye. A gentle warmth from the surface invites touch.

Transactions of light show other rooms southward and westward.

Thought 40: I have returned to the Undying Garden. I should try to interact with the compass again to see if it triggers any new changes in the game.

Action 40: InteractiveFictionGame[turn compass]

Observation 40: You spin the needle, which settles at a random position. If only the seasons of men changed so readily; you could spin them back and change the unchangeable. The needle points to the feather now. You hear a clear chiming sound as the garden's trees and flowers move subtly, obedient to this new season.

Action 42: InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Observation 42:
Silent Symphony
A single bronze gong hangs from its wooden frame in the room's center. There are also silk cushions arranged around the floor in a court ensemble's traditional half-circle, but no bamboo flutes or clay ocarinas, nine-stringed zithers or singers' unfolding fans, are in evidence. A mural that touches each wall in turn gives the room an illusion of greater depth. 

Two entrances, one east, one north; the former is wrapped in shadow, the latter in light.

Thought 43: I am now in the Silent Symphony room. I should try to explore this area and see if there are any clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action 43: InteractiveFictionGame[cut fan]

Observation 43:
(the tasseled fan)
A few neat cuts free some strands from the tassel, and tying them together results in--a kitestring?

For a second there is a dark-eyed boy beside you, whose laugh is yours, but wilder; whose smile is yours, but wider. If only you remembered the augury that you and your brother cast that spring in the kite-flying ritual, years before either of you met the woman who wore black and red and gold...

Observation 46:
Undying Garden
Barren branches and pines suggest winter's quiet. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.
