Thought 2: I should try asking the egg about the graffiti to see if it provides any useful information.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[ask egg about graffiti]

Observation 2: The egg scrutinizes you over the top of his spectacles. "You must be new in town; I thought everyone had heard: Mother Loose has disappeared! A most unfortunate incident." He glances furtively all around before motioning you to step closer. "The circumstances were quite baffling; one can't help but speculate. Can you keep a secret?" Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[yes], InteractiveFictionGame[ask egg about graffiti], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 3: I should agree to keep the egg's secret and see if he provides more information that could help me progress in the game.

Observation 3: The egg leans forward and almost tumbles off the fence, but recovers just in time. "Shhh! Don't breathe a word. She's been kidnapped by terrorists. The authorities want to avoid a panic, of course, but rumors are flying." Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 4: Now that I have this new information about Mother Loose being kidnapped, I should head north to see if I can uncover more clues or progress in the game.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 4:
Bravely, the egg calls after you: "My life is in your hands! I trust you will return shortly to rescue me!"

Forest
The sun has disappeared. Only a narrow north-south passage winds through the forest here; trees and gnarled undergrowth barricade all other exits. Chill air seeps up from the ground and coils around your body, reaching down your neck with insistent, clammy fingers. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 5: I should explore the forest further to see if I can find any clues or items that might help me in my quest to rescue Mother Loose.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 5:
Deep Forest
Wet branches slap your face, their icy needles stinging. Dense underbrush creeps in from all sides. With each step, mud oozes into your shoes. Insects drop from above and crawl through your hair; knuckles scrape against rough bark. The path hooks from south to southwest here, slithering between the trees like a snake. Faint rustling sounds catch your ear, but when you turn to look, all is still and quiet.

At your feet, a green and yellow basket lies on its side. Whoever dropped it must have been in a hurry, because the contents have spilled out and are strewn everywhere.

An iron pot has come to rest at the edge of the footpath, near a tree.

You can also see a cracked porcelain dish and a bent spoon here.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[look over sides]

Observation 7:
Using the spoon's handle, you break the seal between pot and lid. Ever so cautiously, you lift the lid and peek into the pot but, spooked by a blood-curdling howl nearby, you jerk your arm back abruptly. The lid flies out of your grasp and rolls out of sight.

Fortunately, you still have the pot. In it, you see some pease porridge.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[eat porridge]

Observation 8:

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[examine dish]

Observation 9:
It has blue forget-me-nots painted around the rim.

Suddenly, from the corner of your eye, you glimpse a streak of moth-eaten fur hurtling toward you from the forest! Your heart races, yet you stand paralyzed with fear; your mind screams at your unresponsive body to flee. Run! Run for your life!

Too late. Alas, too late.

"Boo!" snarls a big, bad wolf, who is huffing and puffing from all the exertion. His eyes narrow into slits as he studies you closely. "Hey, wait just a minute! You ain't Little Red Riding Hood."

The wolf loiters in the area, keeping an eye on you.

Observation 22:
Country Lane
The footpath snaking down from the northeastern forest has widened here into a country lane. Gravel crunches beneath your feet and a warm breeze riffles your hair as you walk in the sun. Some distance to the west, a few small cottages flock together like children telling secrets. Smoke curls from the chimney of the cottage nearest to you.

Outside the Cottage
Blooming with color and fragrance, a tidy garden snuggles against the stone cottage to the south. Ivy frames the whitewashed front door; starched white curtains hang in a diamond-paned window. A faint path forks southeast and southwest around the cottage, toward the back. To the north, across the lane that runs through the village, a few small cottages line the road. The clock tower looms further west, silhouetted against the sky.

Gradually, the steady, monotonous hum of machinery drifts into your consciousness.

Action 24: InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]

Observation 24:
Meadow Behind the Cottage
With no fences to hinder it, the waist-high grass flows unimpeded for miles, like water downstream, covering the world from here to the horizon. Almost hidden by the grass, a narrow path forks northeast and northwest toward the front of the cottage. A swath to the west lies flat, as if someone waded through it not long ago.

Observation 26:
Outside the Bungalow
A cheery pink bungalow with gingerbread trim and a yellow painted door nestles behind the picket fence to the south. Grass covers the yard from corner to corner, except at the edges, where flowers dance with the fence. Circling the bungalow to the southeast and southwest, a faint path leads around the back. To the north, a few small homes peer across the lane, which has narrowed, but still runs east to west at this end of the village. The clock tower dominates the skyline to the west.

A white rectangle in the middle of the bright yellow door catches your eye.

Meadow Behind the Bungalow
Grass surrounds you, acres of it, spreading across the countryside as far as you can see. A ribbon of flattened grass curves eastward, and another, not quite as fresh, circles the bungalow, branching northeast and northwest. A grass-covered hill to the southwest shimmers under the sun's heat; waves of green-gold grass ripple toward the crest of the hill, racing the wind to the top.

A wooden ladder lies half-hidden in the grass next to the bungalow.

Glancing furtively over your shoulder, you slip the hairpin into the doorknob and jiggle it in the lock. Nothing happens. You twist and poke and jab and prod, until finally something clicks into place. Aha! You remove the hairpin, turn the knob ever so gently, and ease the cottage door open.

You're quite pleased with yourself, aren't you? Your mother, on the other hand, would be ashamed of you.

The wolf leans casually on one elbow and watches you, chewing on his toothpick.

Thought 45: I have successfully unlocked the cottage door using the hairpin. I should now explore inside the cottage and see if there are any clues or items that could help me in my quest. I should also be cautious and ready for any potential discoveries or interactions.

Observation 45:
Inside the Cottage
From the scrubbed oak floorboards to the comfy, upholstered furniture gathered around the hearth, this feels like home.

A wooden spinning wheel in the corner revolves madly, its treadle pumping like a runner's chest after a long race. A skein of black yarn is wound around the bobbin; one loose end of the yarn flaps rhythmically with each rotation of the wheel.

You can also see a big, giant bag (in which is some soft wool), a medium-sized bag (in which is some glossy wool) and a wee, little bag (in which is some curly wool) here.

Thought 46: I should explore inside the cottage further and see if there are any clues or items that could help me in my quest. I should also be observant of my surroundings and ready for any potential discoveries or interactions.

Action 46: InteractiveFictionGame[take all]

Observation 46:
spinning wheel: The spinning wheel is too heavy and awkward to carry, but you might be able to push it somewhere.
big, giant bag: You're already in trouble; one more misdeed won't make any difference. You pick up the big, giant bag and sling it over your shoulder.
medium-sized bag: Your mother won't be happy about this. When the time comes--and it WILL come, you're certain--you'll just have to talk fast and hope for the best.
wee, little bag: You can't juggle three bags full and everything else, too.

Thought 47: I should take the items I can carry with me and explore the rest of the cottage. I should also be cautious and ready for any potential interactions or discoveries.

Outside the Cottage

You can see a wolf here.

The wolf shifts the toothpick from one side of his mouth to the other.

Thought 48: I should be cautious of the wolf's presence and try to interact with him using the items I have. I should also consider giving him some items to see if it leads to any progress in the game.

You toss the big, giant bag to the big, bad wolf, who catches it with a flourish. He inspects his prize and then lifts one eyebrow at you.
