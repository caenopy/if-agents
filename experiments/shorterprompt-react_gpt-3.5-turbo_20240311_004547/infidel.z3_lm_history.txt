You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Input: An instruction to play the game.

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I should start by exploring my surroundings and looking for any clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around]

Observation 1:
Your Tent
(You are in the army cot.)
You are in your tent. Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little.
At the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off cot], InteractiveFictionGame[look up wall]

Thought 2: I should try to unlock the trunk to see if there's anything useful inside.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[unlock trunk]

Observation 2: What do you want to unlock the trunk with? Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off cot], InteractiveFictionGame[look up wall]

Thought 3: I need to find something to unlock the trunk with. I should look around the tent for any objects that could help me with this task.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[look around tent]

Observation 3:
Your Tent
(You are in the army cot.)
You are in your tent. Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little.
At the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off cot], InteractiveFictionGame[look up wall]

Thought 4: I should try to take off the cot to see if there's anything underneath that could help me unlock the trunk.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[take off cot]

Observation 4:
You push yourself up and manage to get out of the cot. Your legs are a little wobbly, though, and your head swims.

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[take in cot], InteractiveFictionGame[close cot]

Thought 5: I should search around the cot to see if there's anything that could help me unlock the trunk.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[search around cot]

Observation 5: I don't understand that sentence. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[take in cot], InteractiveFictionGame[close cot]

Thought 6: I should try to go south to explore more of my surroundings and see if I can find something to unlock the trunk.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation 6:
Outside Your Tent
You are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. To the south you can see a firepit and to the north is the entrance to your tent. Everything is oddly quiet, unsettling, creating a feeling of floating anxiety. The stillness seems to enhance the eerie quality of the desert, the feeling of being truly alone. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

The plane seems to be circling right overhead. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[northeast], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]

Thought 7: I should explore the area around the firepit to see if there's anything that could help me unlock the trunk.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[go to firepit]

Observation 7: I don't know the word "firepit". Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[northeast], InteractiveFictionGame[southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]

Thought 8: I should try going south to see if there's anything useful in that direction.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation 8:
Fire Pit
You are in the center of the encampment, standing before a charred pit, a hole dug in the sand surrounded by blackened rocks. The night breezes have already started the reclamation work of the desert, covering most of the pit's bottom. You can see your tent to the north, the work tent to the south, and the supply tent to the west. Far off to the east, through the heat waves rising off the shifting sands, you can see gentle, rolling dunes. There's an enlarged hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.
Half covered with sand is a bright piece of foil which catches your eye.
Sitting by a rock is what looks like a matchbook.

The plane seems to be circling right overhead.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[take matches]
