The egg scrutinizes you over the top of his spectacles. "You must be new in town; I thought everyone had heard: Mother Loose has disappeared! A most unfortunate incident." He glances furtively all around before motioning you to step closer. "The circumstances were quite baffling; one can't help but speculate. Can you keep a secret?" Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[yes], InteractiveFictionGame[ask egg about graffiti], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

The egg leans forward and almost tumbles off the fence, but recovers just in time. "Shhh! Don't breathe a word. She's been kidnapped by terrorists. The authorities want to avoid a panic, of course, but rumors are flying." Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Bravely, the egg calls after you: "My life is in your hands! I trust you will return shortly to rescue me!"

Forest
The sun has disappeared. Only a narrow north-south passage winds through the forest here; trees and gnarled undergrowth barricade all other exits. Chill air seeps up from the ground and coils around your body, reaching down your neck with insistent, clammy fingers. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Deep Forest
Wet branches slap your face, their icy needles stinging. Dense underbrush creeps in from all sides. With each step, mud oozes into your shoes. Insects drop from above and crawl through your hair; knuckles scrape against rough bark. The path hooks from south to southwest here, slithering between the trees like a snake. Faint rustling sounds catch your ear, but when you turn to look, all is still and quiet.

At your feet, a green and yellow basket lies on its side. Whoever dropped it must have been in a hurry, because the contents have spilled out and are strewn everywhere.

An iron pot has come to rest at the edge of the footpath, near a tree.

You can also see a cracked porcelain dish and a bent spoon here.

Using the spoon's handle, you break the seal between pot and lid. Ever so cautiously, you lift the lid and peek into the pot but, spooked by a blood-curdling howl nearby, you jerk your arm back abruptly. The lid flies out of your grasp and rolls out of sight.

Fortunately, you still have the pot. In it, you see some pease porridge.

It has blue forget-me-nots painted around the rim.

Suddenly, from the corner of your eye, you glimpse a streak of moth-eaten fur hurtling toward you from the forest! Your heart races, yet you stand paralyzed with fear; your mind screams at your unresponsive body to flee. Run! Run for your life!

Too late. Alas, too late.

"Boo!" snarls a big, bad wolf, who is huffing and puffing from all the exertion. His eyes narrow into slits as he studies you closely. "Hey, wait just a minute! You ain't Little Red Riding Hood."

Country Lane
The footpath snaking down from the northeastern forest has widened here into a country lane. Gravel crunches beneath your feet and a warm breeze riffles your hair as you walk in the sun. Some distance to the west, a few small cottages flock together like children telling secrets. Smoke curls from the chimney of the cottage nearest to you. Beyond the village, further west, a clock tower rises above the surrounding roofs. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[get in northeastern], InteractiveFictionGame[examine tower], InteractiveFictionGame[put pot down]

Outside the Cottage
Blooming with color and fragrance, a tidy garden snuggles against the stone cottage to the south. Ivy frames the whitewashed front door; starched white curtains hang in a diamond-paned window. A faint path forks southeast and southwest around the cottage, toward the back. To the north, across the lane that runs through the village, a few small cottages line the road. The clock tower looms further west, silhouetted against the sky.

Gradually, the steady, monotonous hum of machinery drifts into your consciousness.

Meadow Behind the Cottage
With no fences to hinder it, the waist-high grass flows unimpeded for miles, like water downstream, covering the world from here to the horizon. Almost hidden by the grass, a narrow path forks northeast and northwest toward the front of the cottage. A swath to the west lies flat, as if someone waded through it not long ago. At the far edge of the meadow, against the western sky, a few cloud feathers drift leisurely behind the clock tower's silhouette.

Outside the Bungalow
A cheery pink bungalow with gingerbread trim and a yellow painted door nestles behind the picket fence to the south. Grass covers the yard from corner to corner, except at the edges, where flowers dance with the fence. Circling the bungalow to the southeast and southwest, a faint path leads around the back. To the north, a few small homes peer across the lane, which has narrowed, but still runs east to west at this end of the village. The clock tower dominates the skyline to the west.

A white rectangle in the middle of the bright yellow door catches your eye.

Meadow Behind the Bungalow
Grass surrounds you, acres of it, spreading across the countryside as far as you can see. A ribbon of flattened grass curves eastward, and another, not quite as fresh, circles the bungalow, branching northeast and northwest. A grass-covered hill to the southwest shimmers under the sun's heat; waves of green-gold grass ripple toward the crest of the hill, racing the wind to the top.

A wooden ladder lies half-hidden in the grass next to the bungalow.

A cuddly lamb prances about, seemingly unaware of your presence. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[get in northwest], InteractiveFictionGame[get in southwest], InteractiveFictionGame[examine tower], InteractiveFictionGame[put pot down], InteractiveFictionGame[east]

At the far west end of the lane, a massive square stone tower juts into the sky, overlooking the entire village. Near its top, a circular clockface announces the time.

You're quite pleased with yourself, aren't you? Your mother, on the other hand, would be ashamed of you.

Inside the Cottage
From the scrubbed oak floorboards to the comfy, upholstered furniture gathered around the hearth, this feels like home.

A wooden spinning wheel in the corner revolves madly, its treadle pumping like a runner's chest after a long race. A skein of black yarn is wound around the bobbin; one loose end of the yarn flaps rhythmically with each rotation of the wheel.
