(the window)
Bar
Sunlight from the 19th Street window (south) casts an bright trapezoid across the cork dance floor.  In every other corner, the brick walls of this unpretentious watering hole are marked by shadows.  If you don't mind risking ptomaine poisoning, Nikolai's dining room is to the west.  Otherwise, the unisex lavatory is north through a low ceiling tunnel.

A set of Naugahyde stools are pushed against the linoleum bar.

Shards of broken glass litter the ground on both sides of the open window.

Behind the bar is a dinky two basin sink with an attached faucet.  In the rinse basin is some ice.

Lavatory
The low ceiling restroom is painted yellow, the color of urine and bile.
