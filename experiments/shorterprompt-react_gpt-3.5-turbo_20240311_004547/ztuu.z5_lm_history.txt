You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Input: An instruction to play the game.

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I should start by exploring my surroundings and looking for any clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around]

Observation 1: I only understood you as far as wanting to look. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take into northeast], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought 2: I need to be more specific in my actions. Let's try to take something or move in a direction to gather more information.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[take into northeast]

Observation 2:
As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!

Tunnel
You are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought 3: I need to find a way to escape from this trapped situation. Let's try moving to the east to see if there's a way out in that direction.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation 3:
Cultural Complex
This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period."  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription "Convention Center."  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science." Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Thought 4: I should explore this Cultural Complex further to see if there are any clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 4:
Convention Center Lobby
You are standing at the entrance of the GUE Convention Center. On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust. Although the whole cultural center appears to have been long-abandoned, loud, low-pitched sounds emanate from the door standing open to the north. And while these sounds most closely approximate those made by under-lubricated granola fabricators, they nonetheless fill you with dread. Next to the door is a sign, and to the sign's left (northwest to you) is a souvenir stand. The cultural center's lobby lies to the south. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[take into northwest], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought 5: I should investigate the source of the sounds coming from the open door to the north to gather more information and potentially find a way to progress in the game.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[take into northwest]

Observation 5:
Souvenir Stand
You find yourself standing in front of a souvenir stand that is clearly affiliated with the Convention Center. An odd-looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye-catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.

On the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.

You can see a salesman here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[hit salesman], InteractiveFictionGame[talk to salesman], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[eat popcorn], InteractiveFictionGame[examine finger], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern on counter], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword on counter], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on counter]

Thought 6: I should interact with the odd-looking salesman and see if he has any information or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[talk to salesman]

Observation 6:
Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.

Two things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[take mask], InteractiveFictionGame[talk to salesman], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[eat popcorn], InteractiveFictionGame[examine finger], InteractiveFictionGame[examine mask], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern on counter], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword on counter], InteractiveFictionGame[put all on counter]

Thought 7: I should try to take the mask from the odd-looking salesman to see if it has any significance or use in the game.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[take mask]

Observation 7:
With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face. In hellish harmony, two terrifying screams fill the air: yours, as the first human to see a grue; and his, as prelude to a graphic demonstration of why it is that they aren't seen by light of day (to wit: spontaneous grueish combustion, leaving only a greasy slick on the ground by your feet.) Although you will spend the rest of your life trying to forget what you have just seen, the sight of that sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed face and razor-like fingers remains forever etched in your mind. You throw the mask away in horror at what you've just seen.

Thought 8: I should continue exploring this area and see if there are any more items or clues that could help me progress in the game.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 8:
Changing Room
It is obvious from the array of body suits, masks, and gloves heaped on the ground, that this is a changing room, and not a very comfortable one at that. No chairs, tables, hooks, hangers, or shelves here: just the costumes themselves, each piece more hideous than the last. A mirror hangs opposite the curtain through which you entered.

You can see eight pairs of gloves (a pair of hairy gloves, a pair of spiked gloves, a pair of bloody gloves, a pair of stumpy gloves, a pair of blistered gloves, a pair of scaly gloves, a pair of razor-like gloves and a pair of suction-cupped gloves), eight masks (a slimy mask, a pock-marked mask, a four-eyed mask, a decomposing mask, a fish-mouthed mask, a lizard-like mask, a fungus-like mask and a humanoid mask) and eight body suits (a gelatinous body suit, a feathered body suit, a glowing/fur-covered body suit, a rainbow-striped body suit, an armor-plated body suit, a sponge-like body suit, a blood-oozing body suit and a semi-transparent body suit) here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[hit mirror], InteractiveFictionGame[take spiked gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[take sponge], InteractiveFictionGame[take lizard], InteractiveFictionGame[take bloody gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[take hairy gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[take blood], InteractiveFictionGame[take fish], InteractiveFictionGame[take gelatinous body suit], InteractiveFictionGame[take blistered gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[take fungus], InteractiveFictionGame[take razor], InteractiveFictionGame[take stumpy gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[take feathered body suit], InteractiveFictionGame[take pock], InteractiveFictionGame[take fur], InteractiveFictionGame[take decomposing mask], InteractiveFictionGame[take scaly], InteractiveFictionGame[take armor], InteractiveFictionGame[take slimy mask], InteractiveFictionGame[take semi-transparent body suit], InteractiveFictionGame[take humanoid mask], InteractiveFictionGame[take suction], InteractiveFictionGame[take rainbow], InteractiveFictionGame[take four-eyed mask], InteractiveFictionGame[take all], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[put on spiked gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[put on sponge], InteractiveFictionGame[put on lizard], InteractiveFictionGame[put on bloody gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[put on hairy gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[put on blood], InteractiveFictionGame[put on fish], InteractiveFictionGame[put on gelatinous body suit], InteractiveFictionGame[put on blistered gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[put on fungus], InteractiveFictionGame[put on razor], InteractiveFictionGame[put on stumpy gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[put on feathered body suit], InteractiveFictionGame[put on pock], InteractiveFictionGame[put on fur], InteractiveFictionGame[put on decomposing mask], InteractiveFictionGame[put on scaly], InteractiveFictionGame[put on armor], InteractiveFictionGame[put on slimy mask], InteractiveFictionGame[put on semi-transparent body suit], InteractiveFictionGame[put on humanoid mask], InteractiveFictionGame[put on suction], InteractiveFictionGame[put on rainbow], InteractiveFictionGame[put on four-eyed mask], InteractiveFictionGame[lower spiked gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[lower sponge], InteractiveFictionGame[lower lizard], InteractiveFictionGame[lower bloody gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[lower hairy gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[lower blood], InteractiveFictionGame[lower fish], InteractiveFictionGame[lower gelatinous body suit], InteractiveFictionGame[lower blistered gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[lower fungus], InteractiveFictionGame[lower razor], InteractiveFictionGame[lower stumpy gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[lower feathered body suit], InteractiveFictionGame[lower pock], InteractiveFictionGame[lower fur], InteractiveFictionGame[lower decomposing mask], InteractiveFictionGame[lower scaly], InteractiveFictionGame[lower armor], InteractiveFictionGame[lower slimy mask], InteractiveFictionGame[lower semi-transparent body suit], InteractiveFictionGame[lower humanoid mask], InteractiveFictionGame[lower suction], InteractiveFictionGame[lower rainbow], InteractiveFictionGame[lower four-eyed mask], InteractiveFictionGame[throw spiked gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[throw sponge], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lizard], InteractiveFictionGame[throw bloody gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[throw hairy gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[throw blood], InteractiveFictionGame[throw fish], InteractiveFictionGame[throw gelatinous body suit], InteractiveFictionGame[throw blistered gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[throw fungus], InteractiveFictionGame[throw razor], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern], InteractiveFictionGame[throw stumpy gloves], InteractiveFictionGame[throw feathered body suit], InteractiveFictionGame[throw pock], InteractiveFictionGame[throw fur], InteractiveFictionGame[throw decomposing mask], InteractiveFictionGame[throw scaly], InteractiveFictionGame[throw armor], InteractiveFictionGame[throw slimy mask], InteractiveFictionGame[throw semi-transparent body suit], InteractiveFictionGame[throw humanoid mask], InteractiveFictionGame[throw suction], InteractiveFictionGame[throw rainbow], InteractiveFictionGame[throw four-eyed mask]
