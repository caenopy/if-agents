You pull on one of the brass handles, and the attached drawer comes out with a piercing squeal. You hardly notice the noise, however, because you're too busy coughing from the cloud of dust this action stirs up. When your eyes finally stop watering, the drawer is open, exposing a series of small, yellowed bits of paper.

You push the glass doors open. Their hydraulics hiss faintly.

Ground Floor Stacks
This cavernous room is lit with flickering flourescent lighting which makes the ceiling look even lower than it really is. It is filled with half-empty shelves, upon which rest the dusty boxes of many early games. To one side sits a massive, ancient desk, its surface cluttered with paperwork. A sign on the wall indicates that this is the reference desk, which would make the prim young woman sitting behind it the reference librarian. A doorway to the north is labelled "Stairs", and glass doors lead east to the lobby.

Lobby
This is the entrance to the library. The circulation desk dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of desks and tables. A pair of security gates stands before the front doors to prevent people from stealing books. A card catalog lurks in a dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh flourescent light. Glass doors to the west lead to the book stacks; an archway to the northwest is labelled "Duplicating Services"; a door to the north bears a sign marked "Private" in large friendly letters; and the exit is to the east

You are in a maze of twisty shelves, all alike.

(Well, okay, not really)

This cavernous room is filled with shelves as far as the eye can see. A doorway to the east is labelled "Computer Room", and the stairwell lies to the north.

This is a very complicated and technical manual. Hmmmm, maybe you'd understand it better if you had concentrated on hardware instead of software. Quite frankly, the circuit diagrams and instructions are incomprehensible. Better leave that sort of work to a professional!
