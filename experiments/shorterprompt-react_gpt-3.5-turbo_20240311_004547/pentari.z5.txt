Charlie Company Compound
Your company compound consists of three large buildings bordering a large, open area where company formations precede the orders of the day.  To the west the Company's supply building can be seen while directly ahead of you lies your company's barracks which seem quieter than a crypt.  Off to the east you hear the distant shouts of another Company drilling.  Poor souls.

Charlie Company Barracks
If the Army of Bostwin were to publish a new edition of the soldier's handbook, a picture of this barracks should be included as the example other companies should follow.  The floors are polished to an almost blinding shine while each of the bunks lining both sides of this building are perfectly made.  Every locker next to each bunk is closed and locked. Not a single scrap of paper, not one article of clothing, nay not even a dust particle looks out of place.  The powerful smell of high quantities of pine cleaner nearly burns your nostrils. Damn, you run a good comapny.

Your vision swims as your sight of the barracks blurs into a myriad of chaotic colors. You feel a moment of disorientation...

As you begin to materialize your eyes grow wide as you realize you're not in front of the Bank of Bostwin, where the transporter usually takes you in the city.  You're not even outdoors, you're indoors! What the hell is going on here...?

Entrance Hall
Your footsteps echo loudly as you walk through this room taking in the vast expanse of its size.  The walls rise majestically upward and outward to form a huge room which, curiously, is empty.  You can't help but wonder why such a large room is needed for the straight-forward task of accepting guests and visitors. To the east a wide open arch leads to what must be a library while to the north you hardly help but notice a huge, semi-circular marble staircase leading up to parts unknown.

Main Hall
As you enter this great hall you can sense power and majesty.  The ceiling extends far above you while the walls stretch out seemingly for miles. From the entrance hall this room seemed somehow smaller than it actually is. Despite the availability of real estate in this room it's sparsely furnished.  A couple of comfortable chairs are tossed about almost haphazzardly in various corners.
A huge marble staircase winds upstairs to parts unknown while large archways lead east and west.

As you invoke the magic imbued in the scroll it does a cursory inspection of your inventory and decides to turn an item in your inventory into something one might see in a futuristic science fiction movie; your sword is now a perfectly useful source of light among it's other inherent uses.

Library
This is a vast chamber lined floor to ceiling with bookcases filled to capacity with books.  You haven't seen such a collection of knowledge since your academy days.  A cursory glance at some bookshelves reveal several titles on various topics of magic, history, philosophy, science and a hundred other topics.  A few large tables with chairs are in the center of the room inviting anyone to make use of these impressive facilities.

The wizard Morden is here staring at you, the smallest of smiles on his face.

Spots in all the colors of the rainbow dance in front of your eyes as you feel yourself displaced...


You find yourself in the deep recesses of Vamvevmew's castle and instantly a wave of fear and depression hit you as hard as any enemy ever has.  Your hand shoots right for your sword in its scabbard on reflex and you grip the hilt so hard your knuckles whiten.

Castle
You are at the center of an intersection which runs east to west as well as north to south.

Main Hall
This once majestic room was where visitors would come to relax and meet with the formal lord of the castle in a somewhat informal atmosphere. Several large comfortable couches are scattered about, dusty and altogether squalid.  Many large tapestries still hang on the walls but are horribly faded from age.  Large open archways lead east and west while a huge fireplace dominates the center of the room against the northern wall.

Castle, Upper Level
Looking around this large room you are astonished to learn that someone gutted this entire floor.  You are looking out on one, huge room.  No other rooms, no walls of any kind apart from the ones enclosing this gigantic area just nothing but empty room as far as you can see.

In the center of the floor a circle perhaps 30 feet in diameter is outlined in the floor with ash.  The inside of the circle is ringed with many odd symbols you can't begin to identify.  The acrid smell of something burning assaults your nostrils.
