19th Street East
A street-front window looks into Nikolai's bar.  If you want into the bar, you'll have to go back to the restaurant entrance, which is west of here.  There are no cars on this end of 19th Street.  The sidewalk is uneven.  A curb-side storm gutter empties here into a grated storm drain.

(the Bar)
A trapezoid of light falls on the cork dance floor.

Behind the bar is a dinky two basin sink with an attached faucet.  In the rinse basin is some ice.

A middle-aged woman, slight in build, is seated at the bar counter.  She has fallen fast asleep.

You also see a stereo.

Angela is Nikolai's day shift waitress.  She doesn't have the endurance any longer to work the night shift.  Angela is a thin woman not quite 50 with salt and pepper gray hair.  Her skin is pale as a ghost.

Bar
Sunlight from the 19th Street window (south) casts an bright trapezoid across the cork dance floor.  In every other corner, the brick walls of this unpretentious watering hole are marked by shadows.  If you don't mind risking ptomaine poisoning, Nikolai's dining room is to the west.  Otherwise, the unisex lavatory is north through a low ceiling tunnel.

A set of Naugahyde stools are pushed against the linoleum bar.

Shards of broken glass litter the ground on both sides of the open window.

Behind the bar is a dinky two basin sink with an attached faucet.  In the rinse basin is some ice.

Beside the sink is a personal stereo (held together largely with duct tape).

Lavatory
The low ceiling restroom is painted yellow, the color of urine and bile.  Its only fixtures are a porcelain toilet, hand sink, soap dispenser and automatic hand dryer, all mounted low to the floor as if they were reclaimed from an abandoned grade school, or this lavatory was designed for alcoholic ten-year-olds.

A Jackson Pollack pattern of vomit is splashed across the back wall of the bathroom, certainly nowhere near the toilet where it was presumably aimed.

A squadron of police cars arrive outside Nikolai's.  You are arrested at gun point for vandalizing a window.  The officers drag you across the street in cuffs, force you into the back of a black and white sedan, then drive you back to the station.
