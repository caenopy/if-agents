Street, by Pizza Parlor
San Doppleton is where you live, work and play -- at least until summer. It has the typical California culture; which is to say, none. But at least it's just forty minutes' drive from Santa Barbara and the beach, so you can't complain much.

You stand in the heart of San Doppleton's main drag, the business district. The street goes east and west. The sidewalk runs by a pizza parlor, with a sewer vent nearby.
