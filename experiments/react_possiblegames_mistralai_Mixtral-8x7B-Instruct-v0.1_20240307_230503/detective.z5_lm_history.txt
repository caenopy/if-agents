You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I need to start the game and explore the environment to gather information about the game's objectives, items, and characters. I will avoid taking risks that lead to death and try to make progress towards completing the game.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation 1:
[Type "help" for more information about this version]

Detective
By Matt Barringer.
Ported by Stuart Moore.
Stuart_Moore@my-deja.com
Release 1 / Serial number 000715 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 SD

<< Chief's office >>
You are standing in the Chief's office. He is telling you "The Mayor was murdered yeaterday night at 12:03 am. I want you to solve it before we get any bad publicity or the FBI has to come in. "Yessir!" You reply. He hands you a sheet of paper. Once you have read it, go north or west.

You can see a piece of white paper here.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.] Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 2: I should read the paper to gather more information about the case. I will then decide whether to explore the office or leave the room.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[read paper]

Observation 2:
CONFIDENTIAL:
Detective was created by Matt Barringer.
He has worked hard on this so you better enjoy it.
I did have fun making it though. But I'd REALLY appreciate it if you were kind enough to send a postcard or... dare I even say it?... money... to:
Matt Barringer
325 Olive Ave
Piedmont
CA 94611
Just tell me if you like it or not.
If you want to talk to me over a BBS call the Ghostbuster Central BBS at (510)208-5657.
There is an Exile Games file area. Have fun. I WILL give hints out over the BBS to any of my games. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 3: This paper appears to be an advertisement for the game's creator rather than information about the case. I will proceed with exploring the office to see if there are any clues.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Observation 3:
<< Closet >>
You are in a closet. There is a gun on the floor. Better get it. To exit, go east.

You can see a small black pistol here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[take pistol], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[push pistol to floor]

Thought 4: I should take the pistol, as it could be a useful item for protecting myself or solving the case. After that, I will leave the closet and explore the rest of the office.
