What was that?

You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.

"No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind."

After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.

Rickety Fence
The ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other. Although it hasn't fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and if that egg isn't careful...

The footpath running along the fence veers sharply north.

The egg hums a little tune your mother used to sing at bedtime.
> go north
Bravely, the egg calls after you: "My life is in your hands! I trust you will return shortly to rescue me!"

Forest
The sun has disappeared. Only a narrow north-south passage winds through the forest here; trees and gnarled undergrowth barricade all other exits. Chill air seeps up from the ground and coils around your body, reaching down your neck with insistent, clammy fingers.

"No, no, no!" screams the egg in terror, clutching the fence post for dear life. "I'll fall and smash into a million pieces! Release me at once!" Startled, you let go.
> go north
"Leaving so soon?" sighs the egg. "Well, be careful. Dangerous creatures lurk in the shadows."

The lower branches won't hold your weight, and you can't reach the higher limbs. Climbing is impossible.

You amble over to the edge of the path to take a closer look at the trees, but it's dark in there and smells like mildew and damp leaves. Any branch that might hold your weight is too high to reach. Quickly, you scurry back before something grabs you and doesn't let go.
