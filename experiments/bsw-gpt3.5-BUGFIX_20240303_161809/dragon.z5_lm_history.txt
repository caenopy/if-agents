History: Begin game:
Observation: The faces of the council members look grim. Gilgern continues to speak. "Of course, something must be done soon," he says in that gruff, hearty voice you have come to dislike so much. "Must restore public confidence and encourage the return of people to the land. Can't just leave the place to the likes of dragons and trolls. We must all make money again. Isn't as though it's just arrived, dragon's been there for years. Just that people found out about it, that's all." Marzipam looks round nervously at the others in the so-called Council of the Wise. "Of course, we can't afford to pay you much. We are just poor men ourselves. Think of this more as a civic duty..." he wheezes. Around you the other travellers and adventurers shift nervously. Gilgern hurriedly adjusts his glasses and glances down at the scroll in front of him. "Says here that the Great Worm can be beaten," he goes on. "Sword of Erondil is the only weapon which can penetrate a dragon's scaly hide. Enchanted weapon, you see. Last seen many years ago in the Castle of Abercorn. Big, ugly place. Near the sea, I think, if memory serves me right. Dragon must be getting a bit careless and lazy by now. Been there all that time. Stands to reason. Might get in a lucky hit or something." Marzipam breaks in. "Or there's the spell, I suppose. The dragon is supposed to be held in place under an old enchantment, though that's perhaps just an old tale. Break the spell and the dragon will leave, the story goes..." "Well, which of you is interested?" Gilgern looks across at you and the other adventurers. You begin to wish you had never set foot in the town - it just happened to be on your journey, that's all. You've no wish to tangle with dangerous dragons or anything else. As Gilgern looks down, you suddenly find that the other adventurers have all quietly taken a couple of steps back, leaving you out in the front. "Splendid", chortles Gilgern before you can say anything, "We've one brave soul willing to risk their all for our little cause. Welcome, stranger..." Before you know it, you have been whisked away from the town square in a donkey and cart and deposited beside a track. "Good luck - you'll need it!" calls the driver over his shoulder, as he hurries away. Welcome to Dragon Adventure. You start your quest on a mountain path in the North-East...

Dragon Adventure A simple text adventure for players aged 9 and over, by William Stott Release 2 / Serial number 040211 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 Rocky Mountains It is a clear, bright morning and all seems peaceful. A tiny sparrowhawk wheels and soars lazily in the cool empty air above. There is a steep pathway to the south leading down into dense woodland, and you can make out an old building by the path. In the distance you can just glimpse the steel-grey of the sea, far away to the west. You can go north, south, east or west.
Action:[[ Go south.]]

Observation: Abandoned Inn An old, thatched building stands near the path. It seems to be an abandoned inn or tavern, as a faded sign reads 'Troll's Arms'. The walls are a dirty white and the paintwork is starting to peel and blister. The windows are covered in cobwebs and there is the faint odour of mildew and decay. Weeds grow between the flagstones of the path leading up to the door, which leans open. No-one seems to have lived here for years. A path leads north into the mountains and there seems to be some swampy ground to the west. You can go north (to the mountains), west (towards a swamp) or east (into the inn).
Action:[[ Go east.]]

History: Observation: The faces of the council members look grim. Gilgern continues to speak. "Of course, something must be done soon," he says in that gruff, hearty voice you have come to dislike so much. "Must restore public confidence and encourage the return of people to the land. Can't just leave the place to the likes of dragons and trolls. We must all make money again. Isn't as though it's just arrived, dragon's been there for years. Just that people found out about it, that's all." Marzipam looks round nervously at the others in the so-called Council of the Wise. "Of course, we can't afford to pay you much. We are just poor men ourselves. Think of this more as a civic duty..." he wheezes. Around you the other travellers and adventurers shift nervously. Gilgern hurriedly adjusts his glasses and glances down at the scroll in front of him. "Says here that the Great Worm can be beaten," he goes on. "Sword of Erondil is the only weapon which can penetrate a dragon's scaly hide. Enchanted weapon, you see. Last seen many years ago in the Castle of Abercorn. Big, ugly place. Near the sea, I think, if memory serves me right. Dragon must be getting a bit careless and lazy by now. Been there all that time. Stands to reason. Might get in a lucky hit or something." Marzipam breaks in. "Or there's the spell, I suppose. The dragon is supposed to be held in place under an old enchantment, though that's perhaps just an old tale. Break the spell and the dragon will leave, the story goes..." "Well, which of you is interested?" Gilgern looks across at you and the other adventurers. You begin to wish you had never set foot in the town - it just happened to be on your journey, that's all. You've no wish to tangle with dangerous dragons or anything else. As Gilgern looks down, you suddenly find that the other adventurers have all quietly taken a couple of steps back, leaving you out in the front. "Splendid", chortles Gilgern before you can say anything, "We've one brave soul willing to risk their all for our little cause. Welcome, stranger..." Before you know it, you have been whisked away from the town square in a donkey and cart and deposited beside a track. "Good luck - you'll need it!" calls the driver over his shoulder, as he hurries away. Welcome to Dragon Adventure. You start your quest on a mountain path in the North-East... (Type INFO at any time for more playing information.) Dragon Adventure A simple text adventure for players aged 9 and over, by William Stott Release 2 / Serial number 040211 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 Rocky Mountains It is a clear, bright morning and all seems peaceful. A tiny sparrowhawk wheels and soars lazily in the cool empty air above. There is a steep pathway to the south leading down into dense woodland, and you can make out an old building by the path. In the distance you can just glimpse the steel-grey of the sea, far away to the west. You can go north, south, east or west. Action: Go south. Observation: Abandoned Inn An old, thatched building stands near the path. It seems to be an abandoned inn or tavern, as a faded sign reads 'Troll's Arms'. The walls are a dirty white and the paintwork is starting to peel and blister. The windows are covered in cobwebs and there is the faint odour of mildew and decay. Weeds grow between the flagstones of the path leading up to the door, which leans open. No-one seems to have lived here for years. A path leads north into the mountains and there seems to be some swampy ground to the west. You can go north (to the mountains), west (towards a swamp) or east (into the inn). Action: Go east. Observation: Inside the Inn There are a few patches of mould on the walls and the floorboards creak slightly, but the building seems safe enough. As you move you disturb a thin layer of dust. There are some stone steps leading down, and an open doorway to the outside to the west. You see some tables and chairs. There is a dark, intricately-carved wooden chair in the corner behind you. You can go west (back outside) or down some steps. You can see a magnificently carved chair here. Action: Take the magnificently carved chair. Observation: The chair is too heavy and awkward to carry. Action: Sit in the magnificently carved chair. Observation: You get onto the magnificently carved chair. Action: Look around the room. Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look. Action: Look around the room. Observation: The room is dimly lit, with dust motes floating in the air. The tables and chairs are covered in a layer of dust, and cobwebs hang from the ceiling. There is a faint musty smell in the air. Action: Go down the steps. Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look. Action: Go down.
Observation: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.
Action:[[ Go down the steps.]]

Observation: Inn Cellar The cellar seems to have been formed from a natural cavern in the rock under the inn, which has been smoothed and extended to form a storage area for the sorts of things inns need to keep - casks and bottles and the like, which will remain cool in the slightly chill air. There are the remains of some old barrels, but almost everything else seems to have been removed from here long ago. Dim daylight filters down the open stairwell from the inn above, where there is a flight of steep stone steps. By the far west wall stand thick stalagmites which rise out of the floor like dragon's teeth, behind which is a dark opening. It might be your imagination, but you think you can just catch an occasional dry, rustling sound coming from deep inside the darkness. The uneven floor is covered in dust, and at first glance you see no signs of life apart from your own boot-prints. You can go up (to the inn) or west (into the dark tunnel). You can see an ancient silver coin and some barrels here.
Action:[[ Take the ancient silver coin.]]

You can go west (back outside) or down some steps. You can see a magnificently carved chair here. Action: Go down the steps. Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to go the floor. Action: Go downstairs. Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: Go down. Observation: Inn Cellar The cellar seems to have been formed from a natural cavern in the rock under the inn, which has been smoothed and extended to form a storage area for the sorts of things inns need to keep - casks and bottles and the like, which will remain cool in the slightly chill air. There are the remains of some old barrels, but almost everything else seems to have been removed from here long ago. Dim daylight filters down the open stairwell from the inn above, where there is a flight of steep stone steps. By the far west wall stand thick stalagmites which rise out of the floor like dragon's teeth, behind which is a dark opening. It might be your imagination, but you think you can just catch an occasional dry, rustling sound coming from deep inside the darkness. The uneven floor is covered in dust, and at first glance you see no signs of life apart from your own boot-prints. You can go up (to the inn) or west (into the dark tunnel). You can see an ancient silver coin and some barrels here. Action: Take the ancient silver coin.
Observation: Taken.
Action:[[ Go west.]]
