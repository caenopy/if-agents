Observation: Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up. The Temple An Interactive Homage to H.P.

The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner.
Action:[[ Take shadow.]]

Observation: They are sometimes stationary, sometimes moving around. Their movement is not linear and they seem to suddenly dissolve from one place, only to appear from nothing in a new place, apparently at random. Although they sometimes are close to you they always appear hazy. Suddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long.
Action:[[ Avoid the shape.]]

As you reach the bottom, you find yourself in a dimly lit corridor with several doors leading off it. The air is musty and cold, sending shivers down your spine. Observation: The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower. Study Dust and spider webs cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam, blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic, dreamy forms. The walls are lined with bookshelves and a lone desk lies at one corner. Close to a staircase, which leads further up and down the tower, is a massive table made of black stone. A doorway leads to a smaller room to the south. On the desk is a yellow paper. Action: Read the yellow paper. Observation: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom. Action: Read the yellow paper. Observation: On the paper is a coded message and it is impossible to say even in which language the text is written. Action: Decode the message.
