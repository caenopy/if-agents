Observation: <RRROWWGRROWL> Your stomach growls. You've been vegging out in front of that flickering screen for hours, your pet by your side. Now your complaining stomach sets you up on your feet, and on a mission. Snack Time! An Interactive Break for a Bite by Hardy the Bulldog (with help from Renee Choba) Release 1 / Serial number 080929 / Inform 7 build 5U92 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) (For more information please type ABOUT) Sitting Room This is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food. That is a good room. Even though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of "no"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back. Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.
Action:[[ Go west.]]
