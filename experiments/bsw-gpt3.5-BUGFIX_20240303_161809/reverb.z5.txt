Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice.

Anyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new "Surfers Monthly" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening.

Shyeah, right. That's what YOU think.

Behind the Counter
You are behind the counter at "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor", where you are currently working. Not much of a job, but it keeps you from going broke during the nine months of the year when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing instructor. The rest of the parlor is southwest.

There is something pressing that you think you have to do, but you can't think what it might be.
> Go southwest.
You walk around to the front of the pizza parlor.

Pizza Parlor
You are standing in the middle of "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor". The counter separating you from the back of the parlor stretches in front of you on the northeast corner of the room. To the south is an exit to the street.
> Go south.

Street, by Pizza Parlor
San Doppleton is where you live, work and play -- at least until summer. It has the typical California culture; which is to say, none. But at least it's just forty minutes' drive from Santa Barbara and the beach, so you can't complain much.

You stand in the heart of San Doppleton's main drag, the business district. The street goes east and west. The sidewalk runs by a pizza parlor, with a sewer vent nearby.

Two men bump into each other. They murmur apologies and go their separate ways.
> Look around.
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> Look around.

> Look at sewer vent.
By the sidewalk you can see a small sewage outlet.

Two men bump into each other. They murmur apologies and go their separate ways.
> Take sewer vent.
That's hardly portable.

Two men bump into each other. They murmur apologies and go their separate ways.
> Go east.

Street, by Department Store
On this end of the street, a department store called Barkley's sits to the south.

Two men bump into each other. They murmur apologies and go their separate ways.
> Enter department store.
Why don't you just go inside instead of fooling around with it?

Two teenaged girls go by carrying shopping bags.
> Enter department store.

A guy in a business suit walks past you.

A big ugly low rider cruises by, blaring rap music loud enough to make the sidewalk shake.

(in yourself)
You discover nothing of interest in yourself.

A guy in a business suit walks past you.
> Look at guy in business suit.
I only understood you as far as wanting to look at the people.
> Look at people.
They're the people that you meet, when you're walking down the street, each day. They're completely uninteresting.

You see a woman hail a taxi and drive off.
> Hail taxi.
That's not a verb I recognise.
> Take taxi.
You can't see any such thing.
> Go north.
The street runs back west, and Barkley's is to the south.

Two men bump into each other. They murmur apologies and go their separate ways.
> Go south.

Clothing Department
You are in the clothing department at Barkley's. There are many racks of clothes here. You may exit to the north. To the southwest lies the hardware department, and southeast is the cosmetics department.

You can see a store clerk here.

That's not a verb I recognise.

You can't see any such thing.
