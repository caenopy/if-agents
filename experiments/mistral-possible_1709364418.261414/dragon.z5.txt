The faces of the council members look grim. Gilgern continues to speak. 
"Of course, something must be done soon," he says in that gruff, hearty voice you have come to dislike so much. "Must restore public confidence and encourage the return of people to the land. Can't just leave the place to the likes of dragons and trolls. We must all make money again. Isn't as though it's just arrived, dragon's been there for years. Just that people found out about it, that's all." 
Marzipam looks round nervously at the others in the so-called Council of the Wise. 
"Of course, we can't afford to pay you much. We are just poor men ourselves. Think of this more as a civic duty..." he wheezes. 
Around you the other travellers and adventurers shift nervously. 
Gilgern hurriedly adjusts his glasses and glances down at the scroll in front of him. "Says here that the Great Worm can be beaten," he goes on. "Sword of Erondil is the only weapon which can penetrate a dragon's scaly hide. Enchanted weapon, you see. Last seen many years ago in the Castle of Abercorn. Big, ugly place. Near the sea, I think, if memory serves me right. Dragon must be getting a bit careless and lazy by now. Been there all that time. Stands to reason. Might get in a lucky hit or something." 
Marzipam breaks in. "Or there's the spell, I suppose. The dragon is supposed to be held in place under an old enchantment, though that's perhaps just an old tale. Break the spell and the dragon will leave, the story goes..." 
"Well, which of you is interested?" Gilgern looks across at you and the other adventurers. You begin to wish you had never set foot in the town - it just happened to be on your journey, that's all. You've no wish to tangle with dangerous dragons or anything else. 
As Gilgern looks down, you suddenly find that the other adventurers have all quietly taken a couple of steps back, leaving you out in the front. 
"Splendid", chortles Gilgern before you can say anything, "We've one brave soul willing to risk their all for our little cause. Welcome, stranger..." 
Before you know it, you have been whisked away from the town square in a donkey and cart and deposited beside a track. 
"Good luck - you'll need it!" calls the driver over his shoulder, as he hurries away. 

Welcome to Dragon Adventure. You start your quest on a mountain path in the North-East...

Rocky Mountains
It is a clear, bright morning and all seems peaceful. A tiny sparrowhawk wheels and soars lazily in the cool empty air above. There is a steep pathway to the south leading down into dense woodland, and you can make out an old building by the path. In the distance you can just glimpse the steel-grey of the sea, far away to the west. 

You can go north, south, east or west.
