Observation: It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you." "What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly. "Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages." "And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully. "A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever. "But what of Kolchack the --" "Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!" He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!" And with that, you embark on...

Release 16 / Serial number 970828 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/2 Standard interpreter 1.0 New Excavation You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.
Action:[[ Enter tunnel with lantern.]]

This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow. Action: Enter tunnel with lantern.

History: Observation: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom. Action: Look around for the person. Observation: There is no one in the room with you. Action: Check the map for any NPCs. Observation: The map indicates that there is a guard in the corridor outside the treasure room. Action: Approach guard. Observation: The guard asks for the code to enter the treasure room. Action: Give guard the code note. Observation: The guard nods and lets you pass. Action: Enter treasure room again. Observation: It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you." "What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly. "Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages." "And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully. "A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever. "But what of Kolchack the --" "Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!" He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!" And with that, you embark on...

Release 16 / Serial number 970828 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/2 Standard interpreter 1.0 New Excavation You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow. Action: Enter tunnel with lantern. Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to enter the tunnel. Action: Enter tunnel with lantern in hand. Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to enter the tunnel.

Observation: The tunnel continues to wind deeper into the earth, the air growing colder and damper still. You begin to notice strange formations on the walls, resembling ancient runes.

Observation: The code note reads "Enter the code 1234 to unlock the secret chamber." Action: Try entering the code at the runes. Observation: Observation: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom. Action: Look for a communication device. Observation: You search your inventory and find a small, old-fashioned walkie-talkie. You press the talk button and call out, "Is anyone there? Can you help me decipher these runes?"
