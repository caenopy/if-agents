An Interactive Break for a Bite by Hardy the Bulldog (with help from Renee Choba) Release 1 / Serial number 080929 / Inform 7 build 5U92 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) (For more information please type ABOUT) Sitting Room This is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food.

Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.
Action:[[ Go to the food room. (Assuming the player wants to find something to eat.)]]
