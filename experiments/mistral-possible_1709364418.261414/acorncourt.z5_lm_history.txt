Release 3 / Serial number 970904 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/5 Standard interpreter 1.0 Court Yard A good sized courtyard with an air of late British colonialism about it. To the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall with an ornate iron gate set into the rock. The walls of a large stone mansion rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south. In the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window. On top of the west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of sticks, twigs, and leaves. A carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net. In one corner of the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light. The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green. Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone. A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine. The tennis ball launching machine sitting in one corner of the yard looks like a relic from the 1930s.

THE ACORN COURT An Interactive Text Adventure Copyright (c) 1997 by Todd S. Murchison. Release 3 / Serial number 970904 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/5 Standard interpreter 1.0 Court Yard A good sized courtyard with an air of late British colonialism about it. To the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall with an ornate iron gate set into the rock. The walls of a large stone mansion rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south. In the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window. On top of the west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of sticks, twigs, and leaves. A carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net. In one corner of the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light. The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green. Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone. A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine. The tennis ball launching machine sitting in one corner of the yard looks like a relic from the 1930s. Action: Examine oak tree.
