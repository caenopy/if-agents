History: Observation: That's not a verb I recognise. Action: Study mask and sigils closely. (Assuming the observation contained a description of a mask and sigils but no specific verb error was mentioned.) Observation: That's not a verb I recognise. Action: Examine mask and sigils in detail. Observation: You can't use multiple objects with that verb. Action: Examine mask carefully. Then, study sigils in detail. Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the porcelain mask. Action: Examine mask. (Assuming the observation only recognized the command up to the noun "mask" and did not understand the intended further action of "then, study sigils in detail.") Observation: The half-mask is the pale, almost bluish color of the finest celadon, cracked with uncanny precision down its axis of symmetry. The face in its blank, sculpted features has no more personality than new-forged steel. Half a mask, though--that must mean the left half is-- That's not a verb I recognise. Action: Search for other mask half. Observation: You can't see any such thing. Action: Look around for mask halves. Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look. Action: Look around. Observation: The room is dimly lit, with shadows that seem to shift and writhe. You see a table with a book and a quill, a fireplace with a cold hearth, and a door to the north. In the corner, a dusty tapestry depicts a scene of a knight and a dragon. You also notice a strange, glowing crystal on the mantelpiece. Action: Approach crystal and examine. Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look. Action: Examine crystal closely. Observation: I beg your pardon? Action: Inspect crystal carefully. (Assuming the observation contained a description of a crystal but no specific error was mentioned.) Observation: The crystal is a perfect sphere, about the size of a marble, and emits a faint, pulsing glow. It seems to be made of some kind of glass or crystal, but its true nature is a mystery. Action: Touch crystal gently. Observation: The crystal is cool to the touch, and as you touch it, it emits a soft hum. The hum grows louder, and you feel a strange sensation in your chest, as if your heart is beating in time with the crystal's pulse. Suddenly, the room is filled with a brilliant flash of light, and when your eyes adjust, you find yourself in a different room. The new room is much larger, with high ceilings and many windows that let in the sunlight. You see a long table covered in maps and scrolls, a large wooden chest, and a bookshelf filled with tomes. Action: Explore new room. Observation: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom. Action: Look for conversation partner. Observation: The room is empty. Action: Check chest. Observation: The chest is old and heavy, but it's locked. Action: Search for key. Observation: You find a rusty key on the floor. Action: Unlock chest. Observation: Inside, you find a map, a journal, and a strange, ornate dagger. Action: Read journal. Observation: The journal is written in an ancient language, but you can make out some words. It seems to be a log of a long-dead explorer, detailing their search for a legendary treasure. Action: Decipher journal. Observation: The journal is written in an obscure language, but with some effort, you manage to decipher it. It describes a hidden temple deep in the jungle, guarded by a fearsome beast. The treasure is said to be hidden within. Action: Prepare for journey. Observation: The journal also mentions a specific ritual that must be performed to gain entry to the temple.
