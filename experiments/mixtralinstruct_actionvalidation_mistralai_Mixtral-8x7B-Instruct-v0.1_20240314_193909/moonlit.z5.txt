No, not a prison, though stone stands around you, as expressionless as a mirror awaiting face and form; and in the silence you hear no plaint of flute or roar of gong, but instead the crash of porcelain shattering.

Moonlit Chamber
Moonlight diffuses through the walls, tracing out unreadable sigils in calligraphies of light and dark. Stairs adorned with bas-relief motifs spiral downward.

You can see a porcelain mask here.
> Take porcelain mask
Taken.

That's not a verb I recognise.

I only understood you as far as wanting to go the floor.

Shadow Armory
Shadows gather around you. For a moment, dregs of light defined by the negative space take on the shapes of maple leaf, kite, comb, and other shapes that flicker across the walls too rapidly for you to interpret.

Curiously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.

Northward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen.
> Go north
The shapes of light you saw as you entered fade irrevocably.


Undying Garden
Barren branches and pines suggest winter's quiet. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.

A jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, between translucence and opacity, curve and line, and other dichotomies too subtle for your eye. A gentle warmth from the surface invites touch.

Transactions of light show other rooms southward and westward.

You can see a tortoise-shell comb here.
> Take tortoise-shell comb
Taken.

You are not a thing of light and shadow, to pass through things substantial with sightless ease.
> Go west
Silent Symphony
A single bronze gong hangs from its wooden frame in the room's center. There are also silk cushions arranged around the floor in a court ensemble's traditional half-circle, but no bamboo flutes or clay ocarinas, nine-stringed zithers or singers' unfolding fans, are in evidence. A mural that touches each wall in turn gives the room an illusion of greater depth. 

Two entrances, one east, one north; the former is wrapped in shadow, the latter in light.

Skeletal Banquet
It seems this is a banquet room, if a banquet had no especial place for people to dine. Glassware and stoneware are arranged in deliberate shapes, as though they are constellations. 

South lies a chamber of brooding silence, and a vague, sweet fragrance comes from the east. Stairs of blackest marble lead downward.

On the table are a banquet of bones and some ivory chopsticks.
> Take ivory chopsticks
Taken.
