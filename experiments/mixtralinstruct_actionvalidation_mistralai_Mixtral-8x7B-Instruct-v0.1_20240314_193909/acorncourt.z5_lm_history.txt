You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Follow the following format.

Observation: game observation based on previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

CandidateActions: A short list (at least 1 but not more than 5) of valid candidate actions to take based on the last observation and thought, for example '[InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south]]'. Each action is a few words using only simple verbs and nouns present in the environment from previous observations formatted as 'InteractiveFictionGame[<action>]

Action: choose one of the valid actions provided in CandidateActions, or, when done, Finish[answer]

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
GREAT.  THEY'VE DONE IT TO ME AGAIN.  You think to yourself. THEY'VE STUCK ME IN ANOTHER ONE OF THEIR SILLY SCENARIOS.  You glance about with a look of irritation on your face.  WELL, I'LL SHOW THEM.  I'LL MAKE SHORT WORK OF THEIR STUPID LITTLE PUZZLE...

Court Yard
A good sized courtyard with an air of late British colonialism about it.  To the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall with an ornate iron gate set into the rock.  The walls of a large stone mansion rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south.  In the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window.  On top of the west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of sticks, twigs, and leaves.

A carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net.  In one corner of the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light.  The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green.  Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone.

A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine.

The tennis ball launching machine sitting in one corner of the yard looks like a relic from the 1930s.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am in a courtyard with a high stone wall to the west, a large stone mansion to the east, north, and south, and a tennis court with an oak tree and a well in the corner. There is also a rusty tin pail and an old tennis ball launching machine in the yard. My goal is to explore the game and its mechanics, gather information about my surroundings and objectives, and collect useful items.

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that the game does not recognize "use" as a valid verb. I will try using a different verb to interact with the unseen entity.

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that I am unable to interact with the unseen entity in the stone mansion using the objects I have tried so far.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go south]

Observation: You can't go that way.

Reflect: After 5 steps, I reflect on my progress and strategy. I have started the game and explored the courtyard, noting the various features and objects present. I have also attempted to interact with an unseen entity in the stone mansion to the east, but the game does not recognize the verbs "talk", "ask", "inquire", or "ask about objectives" as valid verbs. I have tried moving to different locations, but I cannot go north, south, east, or west. I will continue to explore the game and gather information about my surroundings and objectives, while also trying to collect useful items. I will also try different verbs to interact with the unseen entity.

Thought: Based on my previous attempts to interact with the unseen entity, it is possible that the game does not allow me to interact with it using verbs. I will try using a different approach to interact with the entity.
