To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
The faces of the council members look grim. Gilgern continues to speak. 
"Of course, something must be done soon," he says in that gruff, hearty voice you have come to dislike so much. "Must restore public confidence and encourage the return of people to the land. Can't just leave the place to the likes of dragons and trolls. We must all make money again. Isn't as though it's just arrived, dragon's been there for years. Just that people found out about it, that's all." 
Marzipam looks round nervously at the others in the so-called Council of the Wise. 
"Of course, we can't afford to pay you much. We are just poor men ourselves. Think of this more as a civic duty..." he wheezes. 
Around you the other travellers and adventurers shift nervously. 
Gilgern hurriedly adjusts his glasses and glances down at the scroll in front of him. "Says here that the Great Worm can be beaten," he goes on. "Sword of Erondil is the only weapon which can penetrate a dragon's scaly hide. Enchanted weapon, you see. Last seen many years ago in the Castle of Abercorn. Big, ugly place. Near the sea, I think, if memory serves me right. Dragon must be getting a bit careless and lazy by now. Been there all that time. Stands to reason. Might get in a lucky hit or something." 
Marzipam breaks in. "Or there's the spell, I suppose. The dragon is supposed to be held in place under an old enchantment, though that's perhaps just an old tale. Break the spell and the dragon will leave, the story goes..." 
"Well, which of you is interested?" Gilgern looks across at you and the other adventurers. You begin to wish you had never set foot in the town - it just happened to be on your journey, that's all. You've no wish to tangle with dangerous dragons or anything else. 
As Gilgern looks down, you suddenly find that the other adventurers have all quietly taken a couple of steps back, leaving you out in the front. 
"Splendid", chortles Gilgern before you can say anything, "We've one brave soul willing to risk their all for our little cause. Welcome, stranger..." 
Before you know it, you have been whisked away from the town square in a donkey and cart and deposited beside a track. 
"Good luck - you'll need it!" calls the driver over his shoulder, as he hurries away. 

Welcome to Dragon Adventure. You start your quest on a mountain path in the North-East...

Dragon Adventure
A simple text adventure for players aged 9 and over, by William Stott
Release 2 / Serial number 040211 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 

Rocky Mountains
It is a clear, bright morning and all seems peaceful. A tiny sparrowhawk wheels and soars lazily in the cool empty air above. There is a steep pathway to the south leading down into dense woodland, and you can make out an old building by the path. In the distance you can just glimpse the steel-grey of the sea, far away to the west. 

You can go north, south, east or west.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems like I have started a text-based adventure game called "Dragon Adventure" and I am currently on a mountain path in the North-East. The objective is to defeat a dragon and restore public confidence in the land. There are two ways to achieve this: by finding the Sword of Erondil in the Castle of Abercorn or by breaking the dragon's enchantment spell. I should explore my surroundings and gather more information about the location of the castle and the enchantment spell. I will also keep an eye out for any useful items or potential dangers.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go up]

Observation: You can't go that way.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that I cannot go up the mountain path. I will explore the other directions and see if I can find any useful items or information about the dragon or the castle.

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFiction[go north], InteractiveFiction[go south], InteractiveFiction[go east], InteractiveFiction[go west], InteractiveFiction[look], InteractiveFiction[examine surroundings], InteractiveFiction[take note of surroundings], InteractiveFiction[restart], InteractiveFictionGame[go south]]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go south]

Observation:
Abandoned Inn
An old, thatched building stands near the path. It seems to be an abandoned inn or tavern, as a faded sign reads 'Troll's Arms'. The walls are a dirty white and the paintwork is starting to peel and blister. The windows are covered in cobwebs and there is the faint odour of mildew and decay. Weeds grow between the flagstones of the path leading up to the door, which leans open. No-one seems to have lived here for years. A path leads north into the mountains and there seems to be some swampy ground to the west. 

You can go north (to the mountains), west (towards a swamp) or east (into the inn).

Reflect: After reflecting on my progress, I think I have made a good start in the game. I have explored the mountain path and found an abandoned inn to the south. I have also gathered some information about the objective of the game, which is to defeat a dragon. However, I have not yet found any useful items or clues about the location of the Sword of Erondil or the enchantment spell. I will continue to explore my surroundings and gather more information.

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that I have found an abandoned inn to the south. I will explore the inn and see if I can find any useful items or clues about the dragon or the castle. I will also be cautious and keep an eye out for any potential dangers.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go east]

Observation:
Inside the Inn
There are a few patches of mould on the walls and the floorboards creak slightly, but the building seems safe enough. As you move you disturb a thin layer of dust. There are some stone steps leading down, and an open doorway to the outside to the west. You see some tables and chairs. There is a dark, intricately-carved wooden chair in the corner behind you. 

You can go west (back outside) or down some steps.

You can see a magnificently carved chair here.

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that I have entered the abandoned inn and found a few tables, chairs, and a dark, intricately-carved wooden chair in the corner. There might be a possibility that this chair is important or has some hidden use, so I will examine it more closely. I will also explore the other areas of the inn and see if I can find any useful items or clues about the dragon or the castle.

Observation: You see the back of one chair is covered with fine carvings...

Observation:
There is a carving of a goblin... 
He seems to be holding something...

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that there is a carving of a goblin holding something. This could be a clue or a hint for a puzzle that I need to solve later in the game. I will make a mental note of this observation and continue to explore the inn.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[look at carvings]

Observation:
There is a carving of a goblin... 
He seems to be holding something...

Reflect: After reflecting on my progress, I think I have made a good start in the game. I have explored the mountain path, found an abandoned inn, and discovered a carving of a goblin holding something. This could be a clue or a hint for a puzzle that I need to solve later in the game. However, I have not yet found any useful items or clues about the location of the Sword of Erondil or the enchantment spell. I will continue to explore the inn and its surroundings, keeping an eye out for any potential dangers and gathering more information.

Observation:
Abandoned Inn
An old, thatched building stands near the path. It seems to be an abandoned inn or tavern, as a faded sign reads 'Troll's Arms'.

Weeds grow between the flagstones of the path leading up to the door, which leans open. No-one seems to have lived here for years. A path leads north into the mountains and there seems to be some swampy ground to the west. 

You can go north (to the mountains), west (towards a swamp) or east (into the inn).

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that going west leads back to the abandoned inn's entrance. Since I have already explored the inn's interior, I will now explore the other directions. I will go north towards the mountains and see if I can find any useful items or clues about the dragon or the castle.

You can go north, south, east or west.

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that I have reached the Rocky Mountains. I can go in various directions, but since I have not explored the south path leading down into dense woodland yet, I will go south and see if I can find any useful items or clues about the dragon or the castle.

Observation:
Swampy Ground
Water seeps around the soles of your boots and fills your recent footprints. You can hear the croaking of frogs and the occasional bubble of marsh-gas coming to the surface. There is an abandoned inn to the east, and a path leads south into the forest. To the west there seems to be a little country road. 

You can go south (along a forest path), east (towards an inn) or west (towards a road).

A little man comes up to you and asks if you want to buy a box.
You can see a little man and a large cardboard box here.

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that I have reached swampy ground. There is an abandoned inn to the east, a path leading south into the forest, and a little country road to the west. A little man has approached me and offered to sell a box. I should examine the little man and the box more closely to see if they are important or have any hidden uses. I will also explore the other directions and see if I can find any useful items or clues about the dragon or the castle.

Observation: You can't. The little man says it belongs to him.

Reflect: After reflecting on my progress, I think I have made a good start in the game. I have explored the mountain path, found an abandoned inn, and discovered a carving of a goblin holding something. However, I have not been able to obtain the object that the goblin is holding. I have also encountered a little man who is selling a box, but he is not willing to give it to me. I will continue to explore the swampy ground and its surroundings, keeping an eye out for any potential dangers and gathering more information. I will also try to interact with the little man and the box in different ways to see if they are important or have any hidden uses.
