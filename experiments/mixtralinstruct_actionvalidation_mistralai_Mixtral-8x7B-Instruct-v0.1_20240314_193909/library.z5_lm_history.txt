You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Follow the following format.

Observation: game observation based on previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

CandidateActions: A short list (at least 1 but not more than 5) of valid candidate actions to take based on the last observation and thought, for example '[InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south]]'. Each action is a few words using only simple verbs and nouns present in the environment from previous observations formatted as 'InteractiveFictionGame[<action>]

Action: choose one of the valid actions provided in CandidateActions, or, when done, Finish[answer]

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use the information I gained from that playthrough to make a better choice in the future.

You are a student at Anycollege, in Anytown, and it's the end of the semester!  You've been slacking off all semester long, and it's catching up to you. That final paper is due for your Computer Science class ("The History of IF Games"), and you desperately need to check out a comprehensive book on Graham Nelson, one of the foremost authors of the obscure genre of interactive-fiction. You know there is exactly one such book, but you have no idea where it might be! 

The first time player should probably type "help".

Lobby
This is the entrance to the library. The circulation desk dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of desks and tables. A pair of security gates stands before the front doors to prevent people from stealing books. A card catalog lurks in a dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh flourescent light. Glass doors to the west lead to the book stacks; an archway to the northwest is labelled "Duplicating Services"; a door to the north bears a sign marked "Private" in large friendly letters; and the exit is to the east

You can see a circulation desk attendant here.

Thought: Based on the observation, I am in a library and need to find a book on Graham Nelson for my Computer Science class. I will start by exploring the library and checking the card catalog for the location of the book. If I cannot find it there, I will ask the circulation desk attendant for help.

Lobby
This is the entrance to the library. The circulation desk dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of desks and tables.

A card catalog lurks in a dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh flourescent light.

You can see a circulation desk attendant here.

Thought: Based on the observation, I have looked around the lobby and seen the circulation desk, security gates, card catalog, glass doors to the book stacks, archway to Duplicating Services, door to the Private room, and the exit. I will now examine the card catalog to see if I can find any information about the location of the book on Graham Nelson.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine card catalog]

Observation: Almost no light penetrates this corner of the room. The card catalog is in the usual shape, a box on legs with a myriad of small drawers, each labelled in crabbed writing. However, the entire card catalog is festooned with cobwebs. The dust on top is so thick that it looks like grubby grey felt.

Reflect: After examining the card catalog, I see that it is covered in cobwebs and dust, indicating that it has not been used in a long time. This may make it difficult to find the information I need about the location of the book on Graham Nelson. However, I will still try to use the card catalog to find the book, as it is the most likely place to find such information. If I am unable to find the book using the card catalog, I will consider asking the circulation desk attendant for help.

Ground Floor Stacks
This cavernous room is lit with flickering flourescent lighting which makes the ceiling look even lower than it really is. It is filled with half-empty shelves, upon which rest the dusty boxes of many early games. To one side sits a massive, ancient desk, its surface cluttered with paperwork. A sign on the wall indicates that this is the reference desk, which would make the prim young woman sitting behind it the reference librarian. A doorway to the north is labelled "Stairs", and glass doors lead east to the lobby.

You can see a reference librarian here.

This is the entrance to the library. The circulation desk dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of desks and tables.
