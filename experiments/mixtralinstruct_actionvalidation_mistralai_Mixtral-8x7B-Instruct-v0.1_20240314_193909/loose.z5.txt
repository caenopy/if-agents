What was that?

You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.

"No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind."

After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.

Rickety Fence
The ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other. Although it hasn't fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and if that egg isn't careful...

The footpath running along the fence veers sharply north.

The egg hums a little tune your mother used to sing at bedtime.
> Talk to the egg
To talk to the egg, try this: "egg, do something"
> "egg, do something"
"Pardon? I'm not quite certain what you meant."
> "egg, can I help you get down from the fence?"
"Pardon? I'm not quite certain what you meant."
> Egg, get down
"I simply can't bring myself to do it," the egg moans.
> Egg, I have a solution to help you down
"Pardon? I'm not quite certain what you meant."
> Egg, I can help you down
"Pardon? I'm not quite certain what you meant."
> Egg, come down
"Pardon? I'm not quite certain what you meant."
> Egg, jump down
"I simply can't bring myself to do it," the egg moans.
> look around
What do you want to look around?
> look around
What do you want to look around?
> look around the area
You can't see any such thing.
> Egg, come down
"Pardon? I'm not quite certain what you meant."
> Examine egg more closely
I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the egg.
> Examine egg more closely
I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the egg.
> go north
Bravely, the egg calls after you: "My life is in your hands! I trust you will return shortly to rescue me!"

Forest
The sun has disappeared. Only a narrow north-south passage winds through the forest here; trees and gnarled undergrowth barricade all other exits. Chill air seeps up from the ground and coils around your body, reaching down your neck with insistent, clammy fingers.
> look around
What do you want to look around?
> look around the forest
You find nothing of interest.
> go north
Deep Forest
Wet branches slap your face, their icy needles stinging. Dense underbrush creeps in from all sides. With each step, mud oozes into your shoes. Insects drop from above and crawl through your hair; knuckles scrape against rough bark. The path hooks from south to southwest here, slithering between the trees like a snake. Faint rustling sounds catch your ear, but when you turn to look, all is still and quiet.

At your feet, a green and yellow basket lies on its side. Whoever dropped it must have been in a hurry, because the contents have spilled out and are strewn everywhere.

An iron pot has come to rest at the edge of the footpath, near a tree.

You can also see a cracked porcelain dish and a bent spoon here.
> examine basket
Woven from green and yellow straw, the picnic basket has seen better days. One corner is dented, and the straw is ripped where a handle was once attached. The picnic basket is empty.

The whispery rustling grows louder.
> look around
What do you want to look around?
> look around
What do you want to look around?
> look around the deep forest
You can't see any such thing.
> examine iron pot
The pot is deep and flat-bottomed, with a curved handle that crosses from one side to the other for easy carrying. Although the iron pot has started to rust, you can see where something has dribbled out from under the lid and run down the sides.

You glance around nervously. The rustling seems very close now.
> take iron pot
Taken.

The rustling sounds stop.
> go north
You can only go south or southwest.

Suddenly, from the corner of your eye, you glimpse a streak of moth-eaten fur hurtling toward you from the forest! Your heart races, yet you stand paralyzed with fear; your mind screams at your unresponsive body to flee. Run! Run for your life!

Too late. Alas, too late.

"Boo!" snarls a big, bad wolf, who is huffing and puffing from all the exertion. His eyes narrow into slits as he studies you closely. "Hey, wait just a minute! You ain't Little Red Riding Hood."

The wolf loiters in the area, keeping an eye on you.
> Talk to the wolf
To talk to the wolf, try this: "wolf, do something"

The wolf loiters in the area, keeping an eye on you.
> Ask the wolf if it is friendly
I didn't understand that sentence.
> Is the wolf friendly?
"Huh?" The wolf raises an eyebrow.
> Wolf, are you friendly?
"I didn't quite catch your drift," shrugs the wolf.

The wolf loiters in the area, keeping an eye on you.
> Wolf, are you a friendly wolf?
"I didn't quite catch your drift," shrugs the wolf.

The wolf leans casually on one elbow and watches you, chewing on his toothpick.
> Wolf, friend?
"I didn't quite catch your drift," shrugs the wolf.

"Don't mind me; I was just leaving," mentions the wolf over his shoulder as he skulks out of sight.
> go north
You can only go south or southwest.
> go south

> Wolf, friend?
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

What do you want to look around?
