Sitting Room
This is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food. That is a good room.

Even though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of "no"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.

Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.
> Go west
Food Room
Food room, glorious food room!

Your bowl for food and water is here, but that's only the beginning. There's also a lot of secret places where your pet keeps food and things that go with food and things that make food better. There's a thing that gets hot and a box that stays cold, and that is your favorite because you know there is always food inside there. A cloth hangs down from the door of the cold box.

You can't see any such thing.

It's not always hot, but you've learned to stay away from it just in case it is.

> examine food room
You can't see any such thing.
> examine cold box
The cold box hums softly. It must be happy because it has a lot of food inside it. That always makes you happy.

Right now the door is closed, so you can't see the food inside. But you know it's there. A cloth hangs down from the door right at your nose level.
> examine cloth
This cloth is wrapped around part of the cold box door that sticks out for pulling.
> open cold box
This is a good trick!

You pull on the cloth with your teeth and back up as the door opens. Inside you can see various leftovers, some jars, some sandwich fixings and one shiny can.
> examine shiny can
It's shiny and filled with some liquid that your pet really likes.
> take shiny can
You snatch up the shiny can with your mouth and hold on tight.
> inventory
Held carefully between your teeth is one shiny can.
> go west
From here, you can only go east to the sitting room.
> go east
Before you leave the food room, you push the cold box door with your nose to close it. (It's important to conserve energy.)

> examine pet
He's not very hairy, poor thing, so he has to cover up to stay warm. But he is good at tricks like standing up on his hind legs and putting together tasty foods.

Right now he's sleeping with his arm hanging over the side of the long soft thing.
> wake pet
That's a good idea. Maybe if you make some noise or disturb him somehow he would wake up.
> drop shiny can
You release your hold and let the shiny can fall down.
