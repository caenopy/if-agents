You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Follow the following format.

Observation: game observation based on previous action

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

CandidateActions: A short list (at least 1 but not more than 5) of valid candidate actions to take based on the last observation and thought, for example '[InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south]]'. Each action is a few words using only simple verbs and nouns present in the environment from previous observations formatted as 'InteractiveFictionGame[<action>]

Action: choose one of the valid actions provided in CandidateActions, or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
You awaken in your tent, lying on the floor, with a hangover like you wouldn't believe. As you lever yourself up, you notice that there is complete silence instead of the usual morning complaints of the workers and Roboff's usual shouting. This can only mean one thing - Roboff must have finally run off on you. Panicked, you look around and see your amulet lying on the floor. At least Roboff had the sense to not trigger off your alarm. Knowing him, he also had the sense to take the emergency radio. How the megakrip are you going to get out of this one?

In Your Tent
You are in your tent in the encampment. The tent appears to have been completely cleaned out. It is very hot in here and getting hotter. The tent flap to the south is open.
On the ground is the ancient jeweled amulet that you "borrowed" from Mr. Meshugge.

Thought: It seems like I have woken up in my tent after a hangover, and Roboff has run off, leaving me in a difficult situation. I have an ancient jeweled amulet with me, and it is very hot in the tent. My objective seems to be to find a way out of this situation and escape from the encampment.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go west]

Observation:
Storage Tent
This is where the party kept all its supplies. However Roboff seems to have cleaned everything out that was of any use. Several arrows of Da-Glo paint on the wall attract your attention to the empty food and water chests.
Lying on the ground is a brass torch of the "self-igniting" type. The ignite button is on the handle.
There is a shovel lying here.

Reflect: After reflecting on my progress and strategy, I think it would be a good idea to explore the storage tent more thoroughly. I should examine the torch and the shovel, and consider taking them with me. I should also keep an eye out for any other useful items that Roboff may have left behind. Additionally, I should continue to explore the camp and look for a way out.

Thought: It seems like the torch is a self-igniting brass torch, and it has an ignite button on the handle. This could be a useful tool for exploring the desert or any other dark areas I may encounter.

Observation:
Storage Tent

Reflect: After reflecting on my progress and strategy, I think it would be a good idea to examine the shovel more closely. I should consider taking it with me in case it proves useful later on. I should also continue to explore the camp and look for a way out.

I should look for any clues or useful items that Roboff may have left behind. I should also consider taking the torch and the shovel with me in case they prove useful later on.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine note]

Observation:
"Hi. Sorry about running off so suddenly but you know how it is... With luck, you will die, but I want you to have something to do while you starve so I'll tell you how to find the pyramid. Oh, I didn't mention that I found it two weeks ago? I never got in because the door is opened by putting that amulet of yours into a little slot. Anyway, go to the middle of camp and go east four times and north once. Dig there. Have fun!
   -F. Roboff"

Thought: It seems like Roboff has left me a note with instructions on how to find the pyramid. He mentions that the door to the pyramid can be opened using the amulet I have with me. The instructions to find the pyramid are to go to the middle of the camp and go east four times and north once. He also mentions that I should dig there. This is valuable information and I should follow these instructions to find the pyramid.

I will also make sure to have the amulet with me, as I will need it to open the door to the pyramid.

Reflect: After reflecting on my progress and strategy, I think it would be a good idea to retrace my steps and make sure I am following the correct path to the pyramid. I will go back to the last location where I saw a landmark or feature and start exploring from there. I will also make sure to have the amulet with me, as I will need it to open the door to the pyramid.

Thought: It seems like I have not found the pyramid yet and need to continue exploring the desert. I will go back to the last location where I saw a landmark or feature and start exploring from there.
