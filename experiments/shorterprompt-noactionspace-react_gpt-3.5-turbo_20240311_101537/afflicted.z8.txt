19th Street East
A street-front window looks into Nikolai's bar.  If you want into the bar, you'll have to go back to the restaurant entrance, which is west of here.  There are no cars on this end of 19th Street.  The sidewalk is uneven.  A curb-side storm gutter empties here into a grated storm drain.

> Inspect storm drain
The openings in the storm drain are barely wide enough to insert three fingers.  You'll have to search more carefully to see what lies below.
> Search storm drain
Staring up at you, from a few inches below the grate, are a pair of eyes.
> Talk to the eyes
You can only do that to something animate.
