Ground Floor Stacks
This cavernous room is lit with flickering flourescent lighting which makes the ceiling look even lower than it really is. It is filled with half-empty shelves, upon which rest the dusty boxes of many early games. To one side sits a massive, ancient desk, its surface cluttered with paperwork. A sign on the wall indicates that this is the reference desk, which would make the prim young woman sitting behind it the reference librarian. A doorway to the north is labelled "Stairs", and glass doors lead east to the lobby.

You can see a reference librarian here.

> Look at reference librarian
She is an extremely proper young woman. She has her hands folded neatly in front of her on the desk, and a pencil so sharp it looks like it would make a decent stiletto is tucked behind one ear. She watches the room, and you, like a hungry hawk. Pinned to her jacket is a nametag.
