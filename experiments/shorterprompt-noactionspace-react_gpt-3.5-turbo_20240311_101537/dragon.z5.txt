Rocky Mountains
It is a clear, bright morning and all seems peaceful. A tiny sparrowhawk wheels and soars lazily in the cool empty air above. There is a steep pathway to the south leading down into dense woodland, and you can make out an old building by the path. In the distance you can just glimpse the steel-grey of the sea, far away to the west. 

You can go north, south, east or west.
> Go south
Abandoned Inn
An old, thatched building stands near the path. It seems to be an abandoned inn or tavern, as a faded sign reads 'Troll's Arms'. The walls are a dirty white and the paintwork is starting to peel and blister. The windows are covered in cobwebs and there is the faint odour of mildew and decay. Weeds grow between the flagstones of the path leading up to the door, which leans open. No-one seems to have lived here for years. A path leads north into the mountains and there seems to be some swampy ground to the west. 

You can go north (to the mountains), west (towards a swamp) or east (into the inn).
> Go east
Inside the Inn
There are a few patches of mould on the walls and the floorboards creak slightly, but the building seems safe enough. As you move you disturb a thin layer of dust. There are some stone steps leading down, and an open doorway to the outside to the west. You see some tables and chairs. There is a dark, intricately-carved wooden chair in the corner behind you. 

You can go west (back outside) or down some steps.

You can see a magnificently carved chair here.

There is nothing on the magnificently carved chair.

I only understood you as far as wanting to go the floor.

Swampy Ground
Water seeps around the soles of your boots and fills your recent footprints. You can hear the croaking of frogs and the occasional bubble of marsh-gas coming to the surface. There is an abandoned inn to the east, and a path leads south into the forest. To the west there seems to be a little country road. 

You can go south (along a forest path), east (towards an inn) or west (towards a road).

A little man comes up to you and asks if you want to buy a box.
You can see a little man and a large cardboard box here.
> Talk to the little man
That's not a verb I recognise.
> Buy the box
You have no money...
