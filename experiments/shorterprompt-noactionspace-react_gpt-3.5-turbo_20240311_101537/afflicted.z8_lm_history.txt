You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Input: An instruction to play the game.

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I should start by exploring my surroundings and looking for any clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around]

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation 3:
19th Street East
A street-front window looks into Nikolai's bar.  If you want into the bar, you'll have to go back to the restaurant entrance, which is west of here.  There are no cars on this end of 19th Street.  The sidewalk is uneven.  A curb-side storm gutter empties here into a grated storm drain.
