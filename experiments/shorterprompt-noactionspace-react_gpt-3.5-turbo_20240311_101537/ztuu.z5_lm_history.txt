You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

Follow the following format.

Input: An instruction to play the game.

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought 1: I should start by exploring my surroundings and looking for any clues or items that could help me progress in the game.

Action 1: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around]

Observation 1: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought 2: I need to be more specific in my actions. Let's try looking around in a specific direction or at a specific object.

Action 2: InteractiveFictionGame[Look north]

Observation 2: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought 3: I should try a different approach. Maybe I can try to move to a different location first.

Action 3: InteractiveFictionGame[Go east]

Observation 3: To shirk your responsibilities to the Inquisitor would mean certain, painful death. This, you reflect, is the most likely outcome in either case, though you are relieved by the thought that grues are not known to dawdle when presented with an appetizing meal.

Thought 4: It seems like I need to find a way to avoid the Inquisitor and the grues. I should look for a hiding spot or a way to distract them.

Action 4: InteractiveFictionGame[Search for a hiding spot]

Observation 4: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 5: I should try to find a way to distract the Inquisitor and grues instead of hiding. Maybe there's an item I can use for that.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[Search for an item to distract the Inquisitor]

Observation 5: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 6: It seems like I need to rethink my strategy. Maybe I can try talking to the Inquisitor or finding a way to negotiate with them instead of trying to hide or distract them.

Action 6: InteractiveFictionGame[Try to negotiate with the Inquisitor]

Observation 6: That's not a verb I recognize.

Thought 7: I should try a different approach. Maybe I can try to find a different path or interact with a different object to progress in the game.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[Inspect the surroundings]

Observation 7: That's not a verb I recognize.

Thought 8: It seems like I'm not making progress with my current actions. I should try to think outside the box and consider all possible interactions or paths to take.

Action 8: InteractiveFictionGame[Use the key to unlock a door]

Observation 8: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 9: I should try to find a different object or clue that could help me progress in the game.

Action 9: InteractiveFictionGame[Search for a clue]

Observation 9: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 10: It seems like I'm not getting anywhere with my current actions. I should try a different direction or location to explore.

Action 10: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation 10: To shirk your responsibilities to the Inquisitor would mean certain, painful death. This, you reflect, is the most likely outcome in either case, though you are relieved by the thought that grues are not known to dawdle when presented with an appetizing meal.

Thought 11: It looks like I'm stuck in a loop. I should try a different action to break out of this cycle.

Action 11: InteractiveFictionGame[Check inventory]

Observation 11: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 12: I need to find a way to progress in the game. Maybe I missed something in my surroundings that could help me.

Action 12: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the room]

Observation 12: You can't see any such thing.

Thought 13:[[ It seems like I'm not making any progress with my current actions. I should try a different approach to move forward in the game.

Action 13: Finish[0]]]
