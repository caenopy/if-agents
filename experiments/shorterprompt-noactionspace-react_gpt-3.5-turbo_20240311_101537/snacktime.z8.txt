Food Room
Food room, glorious food room!

Your bowl for food and water is here, but that's only the beginning. There's also a lot of secret places where your pet keeps food and things that go with food and things that make food better. There's a thing that gets hot and a box that stays cold, and that is your favorite because you know there is always food inside there. A cloth hangs down from the door of the cold box.
> Check bowl
Your bowl has two sides, one for food and one for water. Right now both spots are empty.
> Investigate secret places
That's not a trick you know.
> Pull cloth
This is a good trick!

You pull on the cloth with your teeth and back up as the door opens. Inside you can see various leftovers, some jars, some sandwich fixings and one shiny can.

That's not a trick you know.

Just one more thing you can't do with paws. Too bad you live in a world made for creatures with hands.
