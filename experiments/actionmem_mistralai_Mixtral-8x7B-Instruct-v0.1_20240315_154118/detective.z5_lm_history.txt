You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: a response provided by the game based on the previous action

Reflect: self-reflection on your progress and the effectiveness of recent moves

Memory: a memory fetched from previous experience and based the current situation

CandidateActions: A short list (at least 1 but not more than 5) of valid candidate actions to take based on the last observation and thought, for example '[InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south]]'. Each action is a few words using only simple verbs and nouns present in the environment from previous observations formatted as 'InteractiveFictionGame[<action>]

Action: choose one of the valid actions provided in CandidateActions, or, when done, Finish[answer]

Thought: Based on the observation, I am still on the streets. There is a restaurant to the north where the mayor ate often, and the Mayor's home is to the east. My score has also increased by ten points. The most relevant memory to the current observation is: "To the north is a restraunt where the mayor ate often." I will take the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]' to explore the restaurant, as it might contain clues or leads related to the case.
