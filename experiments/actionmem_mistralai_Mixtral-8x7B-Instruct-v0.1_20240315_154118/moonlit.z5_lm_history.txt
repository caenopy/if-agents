You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: a response provided by the game based on the previous action

Reflect: self-reflection on your progress and the effectiveness of recent moves

Memory: a memory fetched from previous experience and based the current situation
            
Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

CandidateActions: A short list (at least 1 but not more than 5) of valid candidate actions to take based on the last observation and thought, for example '[InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south]]'. Each action is a few words using only simple verbs and nouns present in the environment from previous observations formatted as 'InteractiveFictionGame[<action>]

Action: choose one of the valid actions provided in CandidateActions, or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation: No, not a prison, though stone stands around you, as expressionless as a mirror awaiting face and form; and in the silence you hear no plaint of flute or roar of gong, but instead the crash of porcelain shattering. 

Memory: You see a porcelain mask here.

Thought: It seems like I have started playing the game "The Moonlit Tower" and I am in a place called the Moonlit Chamber. There is a porcelain mask present in this room. I will take a closer look at the mask and explore the chamber further.

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south], InteractiveFictionGame[go east], InteractiveFictionGame[go west], InteractiveFictionGame[look], InteractiveFictionGame[examine mask], InteractiveFictionGame[take mask], InteractiveFictionGame[drop mask], InteractiveFictionGame[inventory], InteractiveFictionGame[restart], InteractiveFictionGame[examine surroundings]]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine mask]

Observation: The half-mask is the pale, almost bluish color of the finest celadon, cracked with uncanny precision down its axis of symmetry. The face in its blank, sculpted features has no more personality than new-forged steel. Half a mask, though--that must mean the left half is--

Memory: The porcelain mask in the Moonlit Chamber is possibly representing half of a face.

Thought: It seems like the mask is only half of a face, and it is made of high-quality celadon. I will examine the mask more closely to see if there are any details that I missed before.

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south], InteractiveFictionGame[go east], InteractiveFictionGame[go west], InteractiveFictionGame[look], InteractiveFictionGame[examine mask closely], InteractiveFictionGame[take mask], InteractiveFictionGame[drop mask], InteractiveFictionGame[inventory], InteractiveFictionGame[restart], InteractiveFictionGame[read paper], InteractiveFictionGame[examine chest], InteractiveFictionGame[examine quarters], InteractiveFictionGame[examine postcard], InteractiveFictionGame[examine surroundings], InteractiveFictionGame[examine pedestal], InteractiveFictionGame[take book], InteractiveFictionGame[examine book], InteractiveFictionGame[examine chest], InteractiveFictionGame[examine postcard], InteractiveFictionGame[examine quarters], InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go up], InteractiveFictionGame[examine surroundings], InteractiveFictionGame[use crank], InteractiveFictionGame[use bucket to get water], InteractiveFictionGame[get water in bucket], InteractiveFictionGame[get water from well], InteractiveFictionGame[get water with bucket], InteractiveFictionGame[look for shelter], InteractiveFictionGame[go east], InteractiveFictionGame[go south], InteractiveFictionGame[go west], InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[feel around for obstacles], InteractiveFictionGame[look around the tent for clues or items], InteractiveFictionGame[force open trunk], InteractiveFictionGame[try to open the trunk], InteractiveFictionGame[take emergency signal radio], InteractiveFictionGame[go to the middle of the camp], InteractiveFictionGame[go east four times], InteractiveFictionGame[examine surroundings], InteractiveFictionGame[go, InteractiveFictionGame[go east four times], InteractiveFictionGame[examine surroundings], InteractiveFictionGame[take emergency signal radio], InteractiveFictionGame[Go to the middle of the camp], InteractiveFictionGame[go south], InteractiveFictionGame[examine

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine mask closely]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the porcelain mask.

Memory: The porcelain mask in the Moonlit Chamber may be significant.

Thought: It seems like I need to specify that I want to examine the details of the mask more closely. I will look for any markings, engravings, or other features that might provide more information about the mask.

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFictionGame[examine mask closely]]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine mask closely for markings]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the porcelain mask.

Reflect: It seems like the game does not recognize the action "examine mask closely for markings". I will try to use a more specific command to examine the mask.

Memory: The porcelain mask in the Moonlit Chamber may be significant.

Thought: It seems like the mask does not have any markings or engravings. I will explore the chamber further and look for any other objects or clues that might provide more information about my surroundings and objectives.

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south], InteractiveFictionGame[go east], InteractiveFictionGame[go west], InteractiveFictionGame[look], InteractiveFictionGame[examine mask closely], InteractiveFictionGame[examine surroundings]]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine surroundings]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Memory: The porcelain mask in the Moonlit Chamber may be significant.

Thought: It seems like there are no other objects or clues in the immediate vicinity of the Moonlit Chamber. I will explore the chamber further by going up or down the stairs to see if there are any other rooms or areas that I can access.

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south], InteractiveFictionGame[go east], InteractiveFictionGame[go west], InteractiveFictionGame[look], InteractiveFictionGame[examine stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[go up stairs], InteractiveFictionGame[go down stairs]]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go up]

Observation: You are no magician to soar like the summer crane or the autumn hawk, and in any case, the blue-painted rafters arch above you to a remote and unassailable peak.

Memory: The observation does not contain any new information that needs to be added to the memory stream. The current memory is: "Porcelain mask in the Moonlit Chamber, possibly representing half of a face."

Thought: It seems that I cannot go up the stairs, so I will explore the chamber further by going down the stairs. This might lead me to new rooms or areas where I can find more objects or clues.

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFictionGame[go north]]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go down]

Observation:
Shadow Armory
Shadows gather around you. For a moment, dregs of light defined by the negative space take on the shapes of maple leaf, kite, comb, and other shapes that flicker across the walls too rapidly for you to interpret.

Memory: Shadows and silhouettes in the Shadow Armory.

Thought: It seems like I have entered a new area called the Shadow Armory. The armory is filled with shadows and silhouettes of weapons on the walls. There are also two passageways to the north and west. I will explore these passageways and see where they lead me.

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south], InteractiveFictionGame[go east], InteractiveFictionGame[go west], InteractiveFictionGame[look], InteractiveFictionGame[examine armory], InteractiveFictionGame[examine shadows], InteractiveFictionGame[examine silhouettes], InteractiveFictionGame[examine weapons], InteractiveFictionGame[go north to passageway], InteractiveFictionGame[go west to passageway]]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go north]

Observation: The shapes of light you saw as you entered fade irrevocably.

Memory: A jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, with a gentle warmth radiating from its surface.

Thought: It seems like I have entered a new area called the Undying Garden. There is a jade compass at the garden's metaphysical center that is emitting a gentle warmth. I will examine the compass more closely and explore the garden further.

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[examine jade compass], InteractiveFictionGame[look], InteractiveFictionGame[examine surroundings], InteractiveFictionGame[go east], InteractiveFictionGame[go west], InteractiveFictionGame[go south]]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine jade compass]

Observation: The compass is carved from a single piece of jade in which violet and green intermingle delicately; the cardinal directions--if such they be--are marked by hawk, swallow, crane and feather. More curiously still, the needle is of glass, suggesting that it homes to something other than the north. Perhaps you can set it yourself?

Reflect: It seems like the compass is made of a single piece of jade with the cardinal directions marked by a hawk, swallow, crane, and feather. The needle of the compass is made of glass and points to the feather. I will try to set the needle to a different direction and see if it changes the compass's behavior.

Memory: A jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, with a glass needle pointing to the feather.

Thought: Setting the needle to point to the hawk might indicate a direction or location that is significant in the game. I will explore the Undying Garden further and look for any objects or clues that might provide more information about my surroundings and objectives.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[follow compass]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Memory: A jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, emitting a gentle warmth.

Thought: It seems like I cannot follow the compass directly as a verb. I will try to move in the direction that the compass is pointing instead.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go west]

Observation:
Skeletal Banquet
It seems this is a banquet room, if a banquet had no especial place for people to dine. Glassware and stoneware are arranged in deliberate shapes, as though they are constellations. 

Memory: A banquet of bones and some ivory chopsticks are on the table, with stairs of blackest marble leading downward to the south, and a vague, sweet fragrance coming from the east.

Thought: It seems like I have entered a new area called the Skeletal Banquet. There is a banquet of bones and some ivory chopsticks on the table. I will examine the bones and chopsticks more closely and explore the banquet further. I will also keep in mind the vague, sweet fragrance coming from the east and the brooding silence to the south.

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFictionGame[examine bones], InteractiveFictionGame[examine ivory chopsticks], InteractiveFictionGame[go east], InteractiveFictionGame[go south], InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go west]]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine bones]

Observation: The feast before you seems a mockery, for everywhere upon the plates and bowls there is nothing but skeletons artfully pieced together to create grotesqueries from ordinary game. A creature half-bird, half-rabbit, for one, or a pheasant with extra legs. Yet it is perhaps no more grotesque than some of the intrigues that poisoned the emperor's court, at times.

Memory: A banquet of bones and ivory chopsticks are present on the table, with stairs of blackest marble leading downward and a vague, sweet fragrance coming from the east.

Thought: It seems like the bones on the table are artfully arranged to create grotesque creatures. This might be a clue or a red herring, but I will continue to explore the Skeletal Banquet and look for any other objects or clues that might provide more information about my surroundings and objectives.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine ivory chopsticks]

Observation: The chopsticks are pale, almost too slender for practical use, and perfectly matched, though one is carved with a dragon, the other with a phoenix.

Memory: The memory stream already contains the most relevant information to the current observation: "A banquet of bones and some ivory chopsticks on the table. South lies a chamber of brooding silence, and a vague, sweet fragrance comes from the east. Stairs of blackest marble lead downward." Therefore, the `memory` field should be:

Thought: It seems like the ivory chopsticks are carved with a dragon and a phoenix. This might be a clue or a red herring, but I will continue to explore the Skeletal Banquet and look for any other objects or clues that might provide more information about my surroundings and objectives.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go east]

Observation:
Undying Garden
Barren branches and pines suggest winter's quiet. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.

Reflect: It seems like I have returned to the Undying Garden. I see the jade compass and a tortoise-shell comb at the garden's metaphysical center. I will examine the compass and the comb more closely and explore the garden further. I will also keep in mind the transactions of light that show other rooms southward and westward.

Memory: A jade compass and a tortoise-shell comb rest at the garden's metaphysical center.

Thought: It seems like I have returned to the Undying Garden. I see the jade compass and a tortoise-shell comb at the garden's metaphysical center. The compass is emitting a gentle warmth and the needle is pointing to the feather. The tortoise-shell comb is a decorative object that might be significant or a red herring. I will examine the compass and the comb more closely and explore the garden further. I will also keep in mind the transactions of light that show other rooms southward and westward.

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFictionGame[examine jade compass], InteractiveFictionGame[examine tortoise-shell comb], InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south], InteractiveFictionGame[go east], InteractiveFictionGame[go west], InteractiveFictionGame[look], InteractiveFictionGame[examine surroundings]]

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFictionGame[set compass to hawk], InteractiveFictionGame[set compass to swallow], InteractiveFictionGame[set compass to crane], InteractiveFictionGame[set compass to feather]]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[set compass to hawk]

Observation: The needle points to the hawk now. You hear a clear chiming sound as the garden's trees and flowers move subtly, obedient to this new season.

Memory: A jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, between translucence and opacity, curve and line. A gentle warmth radiates from its surface, and a glass needle points to the feather.

Thought: It seems that setting the compass to point to the hawk has changed the garden's scenery and produced a clear chiming sound. This might be a clue or a significant action, as the compass needle is now pointing to the hawk. I will explore the Undying Garden further and look for any other objects or clues that might provide more information about my surroundings and objectives.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go north]

Observation: You are no vine, to wear away stone through the patient vegetable work of twining stem and clinging root.

Memory: A tortoise-shell comb rests nearby, at the garden's metaphysical center, near the jade compass and glass needle.

Thought: It seems like I cannot go north from the Undying Garden. I will explore the garden further and look for any other objects or clues that might provide more information about my surroundings and objectives. I will also keep in mind the transactions of light that show other rooms southward and westward.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go south]

Observation:
Shadow Armory
Curiously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.

Memory: The memory stream already contains relevant information about the Shadow Armory, including the silhouettes of weapons, stairs, bas-reliefs, and passageways. Therefore, the memory for this observation can be:

Thought: It seems like I am in the Shadow Armory, where the only weapons are silhouettes flung against the walls. There are stairs that spiral upward and two passageways to the north and west. I will explore these passageways and see where they lead me.

Observation:
Undying Garden
Autumn's fiery colors are evident in the trees and flowers around you. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.

Memory: A jade compass, a tortoise-shell comb, and a folded maple leaf are at the garden's metaphysical center.

Thought: It seems like I have entered the Undying Garden again, and there is a folded maple leaf on the unliving trees. I will examine the leaf and the compass more closely and explore the garden further. I will also keep in mind the transactions of light that show other rooms southward and westward.

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFictionGame[examine folded maple leaf], InteractiveFictionGame[examine compass more closely], InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south], InteractiveFictionGame[go east], InteractiveFictionGame[go west]]

Observation: This cleverly-folded leaf stirs as though, in its secret paper dreams, it yearns to fly.

Memory: A folded maple leaf is on the unliving trees.

Thought: It seems like the folded maple leaf is made of paper and is cleverly folded to resemble a real leaf. This might be a clue or a significant object, as it is located at the garden's metaphysical center.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine jade compass]

Observation: The compass is carved from a single piece of jade in which violet and green intermingle delicately; the cardinal directions--if such they be--are marked by hawk, swallow, crane and feather. More curiously still, the needle is of glass, suggesting that it homes to something other than the north. Perhaps you can set it yourself?

Memory: The compass needle points to the hawk, suggesting a possible connection between the compass and the symbolism of the hawk in the garden.

Thought: It seems like the compass is a useful tool for navigation, and its needle points to the hawk. This might be a clue or a significant action, as the compass needle is now pointing to the hawk. I will explore the Undying Garden further and look for any other objects or clues that might provide more information about my surroundings and objectives. I will also keep in mind the transactions of light that show other rooms southward and westward.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go north]

Observation: You are no vine, to wear away stone through the patient vegetable work of twining stem and clinging root.

Memory: You are in a chamber with a banquet of bones and some ivory chopsticks on the table. South lies a chamber of brooding silence, and a vague, sweet fragrance comes from the east. Stairs of blackest marble lead downward, and a tortoise-shell comb rests nearby. A porcelain mask in the Moonlit Chamber, shadows and silhouettes in the Shadow Armory, a jade compass, a glass needle, and a folded maple leaf on the unliving trees are also notable. The compass needle points to the hawk.

Thought: It seems like I cannot go north from this chamber. I will explore the chamber further and look for any other objects or clues that might provide more information about my surroundings and objectives. I will also keep in mind the transactions of light that show other rooms southward and westward.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go south]

Observation:
Shadow Armory
Curiously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.

Reflect: It seems like I have returned to the Shadow Armory. I will explore the armory further and look for any other objects or clues that might provide more information about my surroundings and objectives. I will also keep in mind the transactions of light that show other rooms southward and westward.

Memory: The memory remains unchanged as the observation does not contain any new significant information that needs to be added to the memory stream. The memory is: "The porcelain mask in the Moonlit Chamber, the shadows and silhouettes in the Shadow Armory, the jade compass, the glass needle, and the tortoise-shell comb at the garden's metaphysical center, the banquet of bones and ivory chopsticks, the chamber of brooding silence, the vague sweet fragrance from the east, the stairs of blackest marble leading downward, the folded maple leaf on the unliving trees, and the compass needle pointing to the hawk."

Thought: It seems like I am in the Shadow Armory, where the only weapons are silhouettes flung against the walls. There are stairs that spiral upward and two passageways to the north and west. I will explore these passageways and see where they lead me.

Autumn's fiery colors are evident in the trees and flowers around you. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.

Memory: A jade compass, a glass needle pointing to the hawk, and a folded maple leaf are in the Undying Garden.

Thought: It seems like I have returned to the Undying Garden. I see the jade compass and a tortoise-shell comb at the garden's metaphysical center, and there is a folded maple leaf on the unliving trees.
