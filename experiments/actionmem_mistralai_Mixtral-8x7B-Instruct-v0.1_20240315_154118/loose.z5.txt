What was that?

You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.

"No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind."

After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.

Rickety Fence
The ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other. Although it hasn't fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and if that egg isn't careful...

The footpath running along the fence veers sharply north.

The egg hums a little tune your mother used to sing at bedtime.
> Help the egg down from the fence
I only understood you as far as wanting to help.
> Help the egg down from the fence
I only understood you as far as wanting to help.
> Help the egg down by offering it a hand
I only understood you as far as wanting to help.
> Ask the egg for advice
The egg coughs politely and looks away.
> Ask the egg about itself
"Not a lot to tell, really," demurs the egg.
> compliment egg
"I haven't the slightest idea what you're referring to," murmurs the egg.
> ask egg about the game
The egg coughs politely and looks away.
> go north
"Leaving so soon?" sighs the egg. "Well, be careful. Dangerous creatures lurk in the shadows."

Forest
The sun has disappeared. Only a narrow north-south passage winds through the forest here; trees and gnarled undergrowth barricade all other exits. Chill air seeps up from the ground and coils around your body, reaching down your neck with insistent, clammy fingers.
> examine surroundings
You can't see any such thing.
> find way around fallen tree
That's not a verb I recognise.
> Look for tool
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> examine north
You see nothing special about the north wall.
> examine surroundings
You can't see any such thing.

Deep Forest
Wet branches slap your face, their icy needles stinging. Dense underbrush creeps in from all sides. With each step, mud oozes into your shoes. Insects drop from above and crawl through your hair; knuckles scrape against rough bark. The path hooks from south to southwest here, slithering between the trees like a snake. Faint rustling sounds catch your ear, but when you turn to look, all is still and quiet.

At your feet, a green and yellow basket lies on its side. Whoever dropped it must have been in a hurry, because the contents have spilled out and are strewn everywhere.

An iron pot has come to rest at the edge of the footpath, near a tree.

You can also see a cracked porcelain dish and a bent spoon here.
> examine basket
Woven from green and yellow straw, the picnic basket has seen better days. One corner is dented, and the straw is ripped where a handle was once attached. The picnic basket is empty.

The whispery rustling grows louder.
> examine iron pot
The pot is deep and flat-bottomed, with a curved handle that crosses from one side to the other for easy carrying. Although the iron pot has started to rust, you can see where something has dribbled out from under the lid and run down the sides.

You glance around nervously. The rustling seems very close now.
> pick up iron pot
Taken.

The rustling sounds stop.
> examine iron pot
The pot is deep and flat-bottomed, with a curved handle that crosses from one side to the other for easy carrying. Although the iron pot has started to rust, you can see where something has dribbled out from under the lid and run down the sides.

Suddenly, from the corner of your eye, you glimpse a streak of moth-eaten fur hurtling toward you from the forest! Your heart races, yet you stand paralyzed with fear; your mind screams at your unresponsive body to flee. Run! Run for your life!

Too late. Alas, too late.

"Boo!" snarls a big, bad wolf, who is huffing and puffing from all the exertion. His eyes narrow into slits as he studies you closely. "Hey, wait just a minute! You ain't Little Red Riding Hood."

The wolf loiters in the area, keeping an eye on you.
> introduce myself
(to the wolf)
The wolf grins widely. "Sure thing. Just step over here where I can get a better look at you," he coaxes. "Come on, don't be shy."

The wolf loiters in the area, keeping an eye on you.
> Step closer to the wolf
"Huh?" The wolf raises an eyebrow.
> introduce myself
(to the wolf)
The wolf grins widely. "Sure thing. Just step over here where I can get a better look at you," he coaxes. "Come on, don't be shy."

The wolf leans casually on one elbow and watches you, chewing on his toothpick.
> Step closer to the wolf
"Huh?" The wolf raises an eyebrow.
> introduce myself to wolf
The wolf grins widely. "Sure thing. Just step over here where I can get a better look at you," he coaxes. "Come on, don't be shy."

"Don't mind me; I was just leaving," mentions the wolf over his shoulder as he skulks out of sight.

You can only go south or southwest.

Country Lane
The footpath snaking down from the northeastern forest has widened here into a country lane. Gravel crunches beneath your feet and a warm breeze riffles your hair as you walk in the sun. Some distance to the west, a few small cottages flock together like children telling secrets. Smoke curls from the chimney of the cottage nearest to you. Beyond the village, further west, a clock tower rises above the surrounding roofs.
> go west
Outside the Cottage
Blooming with color and fragrance, a tidy garden snuggles against the stone cottage to the south. Ivy frames the whitewashed front door; starched white curtains hang in a diamond-paned window. A faint path forks southeast and southwest around the cottage, toward the back. To the north, across the lane that runs through the village, a few small cottages line the road. The clock tower looms further west, silhouetted against the sky.

Gradually, the steady, monotonous hum of machinery drifts into your consciousness.
> approach cottage
That's not a verb I recognise.
> go inside
You can't, since the cottage door is in the way.
> open front door
It seems to be locked.
> look for window
I only understood you as far as wanting to look.
> examine cottage
The cottage is modest and charming, a perfect portrait of rustic country living.
> examine garden
Two low hedges, mostly roses twined with jasmine and honeysuckle, flank the walkway leading to the cottage. Just before the doorway, the hedges part company, one bearing right, the other left. Freshly cut grass, warmed by the sun, blankets the rest of the yard. In one corner, almost hidden, a teeny tiny sign pokes out of the ground.

Suddenly, an itsy-bitsy spider scurries across the sign and into the bushes.

         "Leaf the gardening to us"
> examine hedges
Among the tangled jumble of flowers rioting in the garden, you recognize only the roses and jasmine and honeysuckle, although at least a dozen other varieties contend for the same plot of earth, air and water.
> examine surroundings
You can't see any such thing.
> go west
Outside the Bungalow
A cheery pink bungalow with gingerbread trim and a yellow painted door nestles behind the picket fence to the south. Grass covers the yard from corner to corner, except at the edges, where flowers dance with the fence. Circling the bungalow to the southeast and southwest, a faint path leads around the back. To the north, a few small homes peer across the lane, which has narrowed, but still runs east to west at this end of the village. The clock tower dominates the skyline to the west.

A white rectangle in the middle of the bright yellow door catches your eye.
