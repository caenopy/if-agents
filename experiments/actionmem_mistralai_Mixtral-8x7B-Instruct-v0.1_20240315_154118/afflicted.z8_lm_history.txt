Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Reflect: Based on the observation, I was not able to find a different way in such as a window or back door. I will consider other options to gain entry. I can try to find a way to open the door without a key, or check if there is a nearby business or residence that might have a spare key. If all else fails, I can come back later when the restaurant is open and try again.

Memory: The player is a city sanitarian on a health and safety inspection, currently standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street. The entrance is to the north, and the health inspection score for the establishment is 85. The player does not have a key to enter the bar and grill.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that "find a way to open the door without a key" is not a recognized verb in this context. I will consider other options to gain entry. I can look for a different way in such as a window or back door. I can also check if there is a nearby business or residence that might have a spare key. If all else fails, I can come back later when the restaurant is open and try again.
