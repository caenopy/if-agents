POP RULES!!

There's nothing to do, and you're sort of tired, so you lay on your bed and think philosophical thoughts.
(meaning of life, end of the world, etc.)  As you philosophize, you begin to doze...

You wake up with a horrible headache.  As you glance around, you realize that you are not in Kansas anymore.
You attempt to gain some bearing as to where you are...

Large Clearing
You are standing in a large clearing surrounded by a dense forest.  There is a path to the east.

You can see a tree here.
> go east
Small Path
The path branches here.  There are paths to the west and south that continue into the forest.  The path to the east appears to lead into some rather rocky territory.
> go east
Canyon Entrance
This is the entrance to a canyon formed by an ancient river.  The canyon is to the east.  There is a sandy path to the northwest that seems to lead to a beach.  There is a path leading into a forest to the west.
> go east
Canyon Path
The path here is a riverbed that has long since gone dry.  The river has cut several meandering passages into the canyon, forming what looks like two rather large boulders.  A passage to the north appears to go around the larger boulder, while a narrow gap to the southeast seems to go around the smaller boulder.  A passage to the east cuts the rock into its separate sections.  And of course, the passage to the west goes back the way you came.
> go southeast
Small Clearing
This clearing is apparently a brief widening of some ancient river.  There are various small passages winding around two large boulders.  These are to the north, south, and west.

You can see a shovel here.
