Observation:
A beautiful day in Bostwin! You are awakened by a ray of sunlight peeking through a window shade and rise refreshed after a restful night's sleep.  You've given your Company a weekend pass to get some R&R after your last grueling mission.  Wasting precious little time your entire company took off for the city proper to pack in as much drinking, carousing, brawling, wenching and other relaxing pursuits as possible in 48 hours.  In the fields of battle your men are an elite unit of trained professionals.  Off-duty they're pretty much like every other bunch of soldiers you've ever served with. 

A weekend off and what to do? After the challenges of the past year when you were first promoted and assumed command of Charlie Company you've nearly forgotton what free time is and what you're supposed to do with it.

Your Quarters
Rank certainly does have its privileges.  When you were a lowly lieutenant you had to share cramped quarters with a fellow lieutenant at your previous assignment.  Commanding a company of your own affords you the luxury of private, spacious quarters just outside the barracks themselves. As a further abuse of your power your chest and bunk are not standard issue items from the Pentari millitary supply center.

You can see a postcard here.

Memory: You are the commander of Charlie Company with private, spacious quarters and a non-standard bunk, enjoying a well-deserved weekend off.

Thought: My current objective is to explore my surroundings and make the most of my free time. I will start by examining the postcard to gather more information about my current location and any potential activities I can do.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine postcard]

Observation:
It's addressed to you...

!!! Hello, Adventurer !!!

Welcome to the world of Pentari.  Pentari is a spirited land which may conjure warm feelings of a distant time and a fallen empire far away. Be sure to always carry your sword as anything can and probably will happen!

Disclaimer:The Implementor of this world is in no way responsible for loss of sleep, time, job, significant other or any other losses you may incur as a result of your visit(s) here.  Any and all access to Pentari is offered "as-is" without any warranty of any kind either expressed or implied!

Memory: You are the commander of Charlie Company and have private quarters in the world of Pentari, with a postcard and a recommended sword.

Thought: The postcard seems to be a welcome message to the world of Pentari. It suggests that I carry a sword with me at all times, which implies that there might be dangers in this world. My current objective is still to explore my surroundings and make the most of my free time, but I should also keep an eye out for any potential dangers. I will start by looking around my quarters to see if there is a sword that I can carry with me.

Observation: This is certainly not standard issue, it's a nice chestnut dresser with four large draws crested by a double door on top.

Reflect: The chest seems to be a non-standard issue piece of furniture, which might suggest that it could contain something useful. I will open the double door on top of the chest to see if there is a sword inside.

Memory: You have a non-standard issue chestnut dresser in your quarters.

Thought: I have found a sword that I can carry with me. I will take the sword and add it to my inventory. I will also continue to explore my surroundings and make the most of my free time. I will start by going north and seeing what is there.
