You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Memory: You're trying to help a well-groomed egg humming a tune your mother used to sing at bedtime.

Thought: Now that I have helped the egg down from the fence, I should try to engage it in conversation to gather more information about the game and its objectives. I can also ask if it has any items or advice for me.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go north]

Observation: "Leaving so soon?" sighs the egg. "Well, be careful. Dangerous creatures lurk in the shadows."

Reflect: The egg seems to be implying that there are dangers in the forest. It is important to be cautious and aware of my surroundings as I explore. I will proceed with caution and keep an eye out for any potential threats.

Memory: You recently left a well-groomed egg who hums a bedtime tune and mentioned danger lurking in the newly dark and chilly forest.

Thought: It seems that the path is blocked by a fallen tree to the north. I could try to find a way around it or look for a tool to help me move it. Alternatively, I could explore the thick forest to the east. It is important to be cautious and aware of my surroundings as I explore.

Memory: The egg politely declined to provide more information and continues to hum a tune, while the sun has set and a chill air indicates the presence of dangerous creatures in the forest.

Thought: It seems that "find" is not a valid verb in this context. I should try to look for a tool to help me move the fallen tree blocking the path to the north. Alternatively, I could explore the thick forest to the east, but I should be cautious and aware of my surroundings as I do so.

Memory: The egg is humming a tune your mother used to sing at bedtime and politely declines to provide more information, while a chill air rises and dangerous creatures lurk in the forest as the sun has set.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go north]

Observation:
Deep Forest
Wet branches slap your face, their icy needles stinging. Dense underbrush creeps in from all sides. With each step, mud oozes into your shoes. Insects drop from above and crawl through your hair; knuckles scrape against rough bark. The path hooks from south to southwest here, slithering between the trees like a snake. Faint rustling sounds catch your ear, but when you turn to look, all is still and quiet.

Memory: A green and yellow basket has fallen on its side and its contents have spilled out on the path.

Thought: It seems that I have encountered a fallen basket on the path. I should examine its contents to see if there is anything useful that I can take with me. I can also look around to see if there are any other items of interest in the area.

Memory: A green and yellow picnic basket has fallen on its side and its contents have spilled out, and now the whispery rustling grows louder.

Thought: It seems that the picnic basket is empty and in poor condition. I should continue examining the area for any items of interest, especially the other items that were spilled from the basket. I should also be cautious and aware of my surroundings, as the whispery rustling sounds suggest that there may be danger nearby.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine iron pot]

Observation: The pot is deep and flat-bottomed, with a curved handle that crosses from one side to the other for easy carrying. Although the iron pot has started to rust, you can see where something has dribbled out from under the lid and run down the sides.

Memory: You noticed an iron pot with rust and dried liquid on the path near a fallen picnic basket, and the game mentioned that dangerous creatures lurk in the forest shadows.

Thought: It seems that the iron pot has some dried liquid on it, which might be important or useful. However, the rustling sounds suggest that there is danger nearby. I should be cautious and prepare to defend myself or run away if necessary. I can also take the iron pot with me in case it is useful later.

Observation: Taken.

Memory: You took an action and the rustling sounds stopped, suggesting that you had picked up or quieted the creature in the basket.

Thought: It seems that I have successfully picked up the iron pot. The rustling sounds have stopped, which suggests that I have either picked up the creature causing the noise or quieted it in some way. I should continue to be cautious and aware of my surroundings, as there may be other dangers in the area. I can also examine the iron pot more closely to see if there is anything inside or any further clues about its origin or purpose.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine iron pot]

Observation: The pot is deep and flat-bottomed, with a curved handle that crosses from one side to the other for easy carrying. Although the iron pot has started to rust, you can see where something has dribbled out from under the lid and run down the sides.

Reflect: It seems that I have encountered a big, bad wolf who was expecting Little Red Riding Hood. I should try to calm the wolf down and explain that I am not who it is looking for. I can also try to find a way to defend myself or escape if necessary.

Memory: A big, bad wolf has appeared and is keeping an eye on you after you startled it, revealing that you are not Little Red Riding Hood.

Thought: The wolf is growling and asking who I am. I should try to introduce myself and explain that I am not Little Red Riding Hood. I can also try to find a way to defend myself or escape if necessary.

Memory: A big, bad wolf has appeared and is keeping an eye on you, having mentioned that you are not Little Red Riding Hood.

Thought: The wolf is asking me to step closer so it can get a better look at me. It's possible that it is trying to intimidate me or assess whether I am a threat.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go southwest]

Observation:
Country Lane
The footpath snaking down from the northeastern forest has widened here into a country lane. Gravel crunches beneath your feet and a warm breeze riffles your hair as you walk in the sun. Some distance to the west, a few small cottages flock together like children telling secrets. Smoke curls from the chimney of the cottage nearest to you. Beyond the village, further west, a clock tower rises above the surrounding roofs.

Memory: A big, bad wolf has appeared and mentioned that you are not Little Red Riding Hood, and there's a picnic basket with an iron pot, a cracked porcelain dish, and a bent spoon nearby.

Thought: I have emerged from the forest and onto a country lane. There are a few small cottages to the west, with smoke coming from the chimney of the nearest one. Beyond the village, there is a clock tower. I should approach the cottage and see if anyone is home, as they might be able to provide me with information or assistance. I can also explore the other cottages and the clock tower if necessary.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go west]

Observation:
Outside the Cottage
Blooming with color and fragrance, a tidy garden snuggles against the stone cottage to the south. Ivy frames the whitewashed front door; starched white curtains hang in a diamond-paned window. A faint path forks southeast and southwest around the cottage, toward the back. To the north, across the lane that runs through the village, a few small cottages line the road. The clock tower looms further west, silhouetted against the sky.

Memory: A big, bad wolf has appeared and is keeping an eye on you with a big grin, while an iron pot with something dribbled inside and a cracked porcelain dish lie next to a tree, near a picnic basket on the path between the northeastern forest and the village.

Thought: I have arrived at a cottage with a garden and a few other small cottages nearby. The clock tower is also visible in the distance. The sound of machinery is present in the background. I should explore the cottage and its surroundings, taking note of any objects or details that might be important. I can also approach the other cottages and the clock tower if necessary.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[approach cottage]

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Reflect: It seems that "approach" is not a valid verb in this context. I should try to be more specific in my actions. I can try to go to the cottage or examine it more closely to see if there is anything interesting or useful there.

Memory: A big, bad wolf has appeared and mentioned that you are not Little Red Riding Hood, and it is now night with a chill air seeping up from the ground, while dangerous creatures lurk in the shadows of the forest.

Thought: The front door of the cottage is slightly ajar. I should go inside and explore the cottage to see if there is anything interesting or useful there. I can also continue to be cautious and aware of my surroundings, as there may be other dangers in the area.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go inside]

Observation: You can't, since the cottage door is in the way.

Memory: A big, bad wolf has appeared and mentioned that you are not Little Red Riding Hood, and the game mentioned that you can't go through the cottage door.

Thought: It seems that I cannot go inside the cottage because the door is in the way. I should try to open the door or find another way to enter the cottage. I can also continue to be cautious and aware of my surroundings, as there may be other dangers in the area.

Observation: It seems to be locked.

Memory: A big, bad wolf has appeared and mentioned that you are not Little Red Riding Hood, and the wolf is currently keeping an eye on you.

Thought: It seems that the front door is locked. I could try to find another way to enter the cottage, such as looking for a window or a back door. Alternatively, I could try to find a key or a way to pick the lock. Since the wolf is still nearby, I should be cautious and avoid attracting its attention.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[look for window]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Memory: A big, bad wolf has appeared and mentioned that you are not Little Red Riding Hood, and it is grinning while leaning casually on one elbow, chewing on a toothpick.

Thought: It seems that the game does not recognize "look for window" as a valid command. I should try to be more specific in my actions. I can examine the cottage more closely to see if there are any windows or other points of entry. I can also continue to be cautious and aware of my surroundings, as there may be other dangers in the area.

Observation: The cottage is modest and charming, a perfect portrait of rustic country living.

Memory: A big, bad wolf has appeared and mentioned that you are not Little Red Riding Hood, and it's nighttime with a chill in the air, but despite the dangerous creatures in the forest shadows, the wolf seems more interested in conversing than attacking.

Thought: The cottage appears to be a typical country cottage, with a tidy garden and a few small cottages nearby. The clock tower is also visible in the distance. I should continue to explore the cottage and its surroundings, taking note of any objects or details that might be important. I can also approach the other cottages and the clock tower if necessary.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine garden]

Observation: Two low hedges, mostly roses twined with jasmine and honeysuckle, flank the walkway leading to the cottage. Just before the doorway, the hedges part company, one bearing right, the other left. Freshly cut grass, warmed by the sun, blankets the rest of the yard. In one corner, almost hidden, a teeny tiny sign pokes out of the ground.

Reflect: The garden in front of the cottage is well-maintained, with two hedges flanking the walkway leading to the front door. There is also a sign hidden in one corner of the yard. I should examine the sign and the hedges more closely to see if there is anything interesting or useful there. I should also continue to be cautious and aware of my surroundings, as there may be other dangers in the area.

Memory: A big, bad wolf has appeared and mentioned that you are not Little Red Riding Hood, and it's nighttime with dangerous creatures in the forest shadows.

Thought: The sign in the garden warns of the presence of a wolf. This could be the same wolf that I encountered earlier. I should continue to be cautious and aware of my surroundings, as there may be other dangers in the area.

Observation:
Professional Landscape Maintenance
           by Mary Contrary, Inc.

Memory: A big, bad wolf has appeared and mentioned that you are not Little Red Riding Hood, and an itsy-bitsy spider was just seen near a sign for Professional Landscape Maintenance by Mary Contrary, Inc.

Thought: The sign in the garden is for a professional landscape maintenance company called Mary Contrary, Inc. It is a playful reference to the nursery rhyme "The Itsy Bitsy Spider." The appearance of the spider on the sign is a coincidence and does not seem to be related to the game.

Observation: Among the tangled jumble of flowers rioting in the garden, you recognize only the roses and jasmine and honeysuckle, although at least a dozen other varieties contend for the same plot of earth, air and water.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go west]

Observation:
Outside the Bungalow
A cheery pink bungalow with gingerbread trim and a yellow painted door nestles behind the picket fence to the south. Grass covers the yard from corner to corner, except at the edges, where flowers dance with the fence. Circling the bungalow to the southeast and southwest, a faint path leads around the back. To the north, a few small homes peer across the lane, which has narrowed, but still runs east to west at this end of the village. The clock tower dominates the skyline to the west.

Memory: You see a well-gummed egg at the top of a rickety wooden fence who could use some help. The egg is humming a tune your mother used to sing at bedtime. The sun has disappeared and a chill air seeps up from the ground, and dangerous creatures lurk in the shadows of the forest. There is a picnic basket on the path, which contains an iron pot, a cracked porcelain dish, and a bent spoon. The iron pot is deep and flat-bottomed, with a curved handle and some rust. Something has dribbled out from under the lid and run down the sides. A big, bad wolf has appeared and mentioned that you are not Little Red Riding Hood. The wolf has a big grin and is leaning casually on one elbow, chewing on a toothpick. The game mentioned a landscaping company called 'Professional Landscape Maintenance by Mary Contrary, Inc.' and there is a sign for it in the garden.

Thought: The egg seems to be in a precarious position atop the rickety fence. I should help it down from the fence to ensure its safety. I can also try to engage it in conversation to gather more information about the game and its objectives.

The game mentioned that the sun has set, causing a chill and dangerous creatures in the forest, and there's a sign for a landscaping company in the garden.
