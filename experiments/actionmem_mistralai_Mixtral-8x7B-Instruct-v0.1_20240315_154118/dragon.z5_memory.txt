The council members are discussing the dragon in the town. They mention that the dragon has been in the area for years, but people only recently found out about it. They mention the Sword of Erondil as the only weapon that can penetrate a dragon's scaly hide and that it was last seen in the Castle of Abercorn. They also mention a spell that could be used to make the dragon leave. Gilgern chooses you to take on the quest to deal with the dragon. You are taken to a mountain path in the North-East.

The cellar of the abandoned inn, 'Troll's Arms', is formed from a natural cavern in the rock under the inn. It has been smoothed and extended to form a storage area for casks and bottles.

There is a dark opening behind thick stalagmites by the far west wall, from which an occasional dry, rustling sound can be heard. An ancient silver coin and some barrels are present in the cellar.
