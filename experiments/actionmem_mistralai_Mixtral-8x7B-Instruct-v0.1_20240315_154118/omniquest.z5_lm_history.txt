You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: a response provided by the game based on the previous action

Reflect: self-reflection on your progress and the effectiveness of recent moves

Memory: a memory fetched from previous experience and based the current situation
            
Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

CandidateActions: A short list (at least 1 but not more than 5) of valid candidate actions to take based on the last observation and thought, for example '[InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south]]'. Each action is a few words using only simple verbs and nouns present in the environment from previous observations formatted as 'InteractiveFictionGame[<action>]

Action: choose one of the valid actions provided in CandidateActions, or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Large Clearing
You are standing in a large clearing surrounded by a dense forest.  There is a path to the east.

You can see a tree here.

Memory: You are standing in a large clearing surrounded by a dense forest with a path to the east and a tree present.

Thought: Given my current location in a large clearing surrounded by a dense forest with a path to the east and a tree present, I have a few options. I could explore the path to the east, examine the tree, or simply stay in the clearing. Since my goal is to gather as much information as possible, I will start by exploring the path to the east. I will also keep in mind the possibility of collecting useful items and avoiding any dangers.

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south], InteractiveFictionGame[go east], InteractiveFictionGame[go west], InteractiveFictionGame[look], InteractiveFictionGame[examine tree], InteractiveFictionGame[take action to explore the path to the east]]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go east]

Observation:
Small Path
The path branches here.  There are paths to the west and south that continue into the forest.  The path to the east appears to lead into some rather rocky territory.

Memory: The path splits in three directions, with rocky terrain to the east.

Thought: Given the new information that the path splits in three directions, I will explore the path to the east first, as it leads into some rocky territory. This might be a challenging area, and I want to be prepared for any obstacles or dangers. I will also remember to keep an eye out for any useful items that might help me on my journey.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go east]

Observation:
Canyon Entrance
This is the entrance to a canyon formed by an ancient river.  The canyon is to the east.  There is a sandy path to the northwest that seems to lead to a beach.  There is a path leading into a forest to the west.

Memory: The canyon entrance is to the east, with a path to the west leading into a forest and a sandy path to the northwest that seems to lead to a beach.

Thought: Given my current location at the entrance of the canyon, I have several options. I could explore the canyon to the east, the forest to the west, or the sandy path to the northwest that seems to lead to a beach. Since my goal is to gather as much information as possible, I will start by exploring the canyon to the east. This might be a challenging area, and I want to be prepared for any obstacles or dangers. I will also remember to keep an eye out for any useful items that might help me on my journey.

Candidate actions: [InteractiveFictionGame[go east], InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[look], InteractiveFictionGame[examine surroundings], InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[inventory], InteractiveFictionGame[restart]]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go east]

Observation:
Canyon Path
The path here is a riverbed that has long since gone dry.  The river has cut several meandering passages into the canyon, forming what looks like two rather large boulders.  A passage to the north appears to go around the larger boulder, while a narrow gap to the southeast seems to go around the smaller boulder.  A passage to the east cuts the rock into its separate sections.  And of course, the passage to the west goes back the way you came.

Reflect: Given my current location in the canyon path, I have several options. I could explore the passage to the north, the narrow gap to the southeast, or the passage to the east that cuts the rock into separate sections. Since my goal is to gather as much information as possible, I will start by exploring the passage to the north. This might be a challenging area, and I want to be prepared for any obstacles or dangers. I will also remember to keep an eye out for any useful items that might help me on my journey.

Memory: The path through the canyon has two large boulders with passages to the north and southeast, and a passage to the east that cuts the rock into separate sections.

Thought: I see that the passage to the north loops back to the same location. Therefore, exploring the passage to the north would not provide any new information. Instead, I will explore the narrow gap to the southeast. This might be a challenging area, and I want to be prepared for any obstacles or dangers. I will also remember to keep an eye out for any useful items that might help me on my journey.

Observation:
Small Clearing
This clearing is apparently a brief widening of some ancient river.  There are various small passages winding around two large boulders.  These are to the north, south, and west.

You can see a shovel here.

Memory: In a small clearing, there are two large boulders to the north, south, and west, with passages around and between them, and a shovel is present.

Thought: Given my current location in a small clearing with two large boulders and passages around and between them, I have several options. I could explore the passages to the north, south, or west. I also see a shovel here. Since my goal is to gather as much information as possible, I will start by exploring the passage to the north. I will also consider picking up the shovel, as it might be a useful item for future obstacles.

Since I don't have any information about these passages yet, I will explore the passage to the north first. I will also consider picking up the shovel, as it might be a useful item for future obstacles.

Observation:
Canyon Path
The path here is a riverbed that has long since gone dry.  The river has cut several meandering passages into the canyon, forming what looks like two rather large boulders.  A passage to the north appears to go around the larger boulder, while a narrow gap to the southeast seems to go around the smaller boulder.  A passage to the east cuts the rock into its separate sections.  And of course, the passage to the west goes back the way you came.

Memory: The player is in a canyon path with passages to the north, southeast, east, and west. There are two large boulders and the path cuts the rock into separate sections to the east.

Thought: Given my current location in a canyon path with passages to the north, southeast, east, and west, I will explore the passage to the east, as I have not been there yet. This passage cuts the rock into separate sections, which might lead to new areas. I will also keep an eye out for any useful items or potential dangers.
