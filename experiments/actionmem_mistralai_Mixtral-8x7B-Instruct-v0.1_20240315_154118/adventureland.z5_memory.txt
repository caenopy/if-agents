The new memory would be "You're in a forest. Obvious exits: North, South, East, West, Up. You can also see: trees". This is because the observation contains new information that should be remembered in addition to the memory stream. The memory stream is currently empty, so any new information would be added as the new memory.
You're in a forest. Obvious exits: North, South, East, West, Up. You can also see: trees.
"You're in a sunny meadow. Obvious exits: North, South, East, West. You can also see: sleeping Dragon - sign reads- IN SOME CASES MUD IS GOOD, IN OTHERS..."
"You're in a sunny meadow. Obvious exits: North, South, East, West. You can also see: sleeping Dragon - sign reads- IN SOME CASES MUD IS GOOD, IN OTHERS..."
The new memory would be "The sign reads: IN SOME CASES MUD IS GOOD, IN OTHERS....". This is because the observation contains new information that should be added to the memory stream. The current memory stream is "You're in a forest. Obvious exits: North, South, East, West, Up. You can also see: trees". The observation contains the text of the sign, which is new information that should be remembered. The memory stream does not already contain this information, so it should be added as the new memory.
Based on the given format, here are some examples of how to produce the `new_memory` field:
Observation: You're in a sunny meadow. Obvious exits: North, South, East, West. You can also see: sleeping Dragon - sign reads- IN SOME CASES MUD IS GOOD, IN OTHERS...
Memory Stream: The new memory would be "You're in a sunny meadow. Obvious exits: North, South, East, West. You can also see: sleeping Dragon - sign reads- IN SOME CASES MUD IS GOOD, IN OTHERS...". This is because the observation contains new information that should be remembered in addition to the memory stream. The memory stream is currently empty, so any new information would be added as the new memory.
Based on the given format, here are some examples of how to produce the `new_memory` field:
Observation: You're in a sunny meadow. Obvious exits: North, South, East, West. You can also see: sleeping Dragon - sign reads- IN SOME CASES MUD IS GOOD, IN OTHERS...
Memory Stream: The new memory would be "". This is because the observation does not contain any new information that is not already in the memory stream. The memory stream is "You're in a sunny meadow. Obvious exits: North, South, East, West. You can also see: sleeping Dragon - sign reads- IN SOME CASES MUD IS GOOD, IN OTHERS...", which already includes all of the information in the observation.
To produce the `new_memory` field, you need to compare the `observation` to the `memory_stream` and determine if there is any new information that should be added to the memory. If there is, then the `new_memory` field should be set to that new information. If there is no new information, then the `new_memory` field should be set to an empty string.
To produce the `new_memory` field, you can follow these steps:
1. Compare the `observation` to the `memory_stream`.
2. Determine if there is any new information in the `observation` that is not already in the `memory_stream`.
3. If there is new information, set the `new_memory` field to that new information.
4. If there is no new information, set the `new_memory` field to an empty string.
