To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice.

Anyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new "Surfers Monthly" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening.

Shyeah, right. That's what YOU think.

Behind the Counter
You are behind the counter at "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor", where you are currently working. Not much of a job, but it keeps you from going broke during the nine months of the year when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing instructor. The rest of the parlor is southwest.

There is something pressing that you think you have to do, but you can't think what it might be.

Memory: The player is a pizza delivery person at "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor" who needs to remember what they were supposed to do before their shift ends.

Thought: Based on the observation and memory, it seems that I need to remember what I was supposed to do before my shift ends. I will look around the area behind the counter and check if there are any reminders or notes that might help me remember.

"Stanley,
    Don't forget to make your delivery to Mr. Calzone, located at the San Doppleton Courthouse. You're already on thin ice, kid. One more screwup and you can expect to be looking for a new job."

The note is signed with the initials "RT". The paper is official "Mr. Tasty's" stationery with the name Bob "Tasty" Tasker and lots of balloons and smiley faces all over the border. Isn't that cute?

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[go south]

Observation:
Street, by Pizza Parlor
San Doppleton is where you live, work and play -- at least until summer. It has the typical California culture; which is to say, none. But at least it's just forty minutes' drive from Santa Barbara and the beach, so you can't complain much.

You stand in the heart of San Doppleton's main drag, the business district. The street goes east and west. The sidewalk runs by a pizza parlor, with a sewer vent nearby.

Two teenaged girls go by carrying shopping bags.

Memory: The player, a pizza delivery person at "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor," needs to deliver a pizza to Mr. Calzone at the San Doppleton Courthouse, which is located southwest of the parlor.

Thought: Based on the observation and memory, I have left the pizza parlor and am now on the main street of San Doppleton.

Observation:
Courthouse
You are in a crowded courthouse.  The street is off to the north.

The courtroom is currently abuzz with excitement as it seems that the pre-trial hearing of the infamous gangster, Guido "The Armadillo" Calzone is winding to a close. Guido and his hotshot lawyer sit placidly at their table, while the flustered young district attorney who is prosecuting the case seems like she's at her wits' end. At the moment, the D.A. stands at the front of the courtroom, arguing over a legal point with the judge.

Memory: The player is a pizza delivery person who needs to deliver a pizza to Mr. Calzone at the San Doppleton Courthouse, but is currently unable to remember this task and is behind the counter at "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor."

However, I am not there to watch a trial, I am there to deliver a pizza to Mr. Calzone. I will try to approach Mr. Calzone and his lawyer's table and offer them the pizza.

Observation:
You already have that.

"Miss Thompson," says the judge, "I've had about enough of you wasting this court's time. Unless you can demonstrate a clear threat to public safety, I'm going to recommend that Mr. Calzone be transported to a minimum security prison pending further review. His trial is to be held next week."  The district attorney is clearly not happy with this pronouncement.

Memory: The player is a pizza delivery person who needs to deliver a pizza to Guido "The Armadillo" Calzone at the San Doppleton Courthouse, but is currently unsure of what to do next.

Thought: Based on the observation and memory, it seems that I have already taken the pizza box and the judge is about to make a recommendation regarding Mr. Calzone's imprisonment. It is not clear if I have already delivered the pizza to Mr. Calzone or not. However, since I have the pizza box with me, I will assume that I have not delivered it yet. I will approach Mr. Calzone and offer him the pizza before the judge makes his recommendation.
