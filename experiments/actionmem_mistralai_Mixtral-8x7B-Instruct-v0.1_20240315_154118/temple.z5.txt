Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.

Void
You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner.

Void
You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner. 

A cascade of red colour explodes below you.
> move towards explosion
You can't see any such thing.
> go south
You move, or rather you come to a new place. The concept of body and movement seems different here.

Void
This new location is not much different from the one you came from. The shadows are still moving around at random through the abyss, reverberating with strange sounds and coloured light.

Suddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long.
> move away from shape
You can't see any such thing.
> go north
In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.

The shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.

Roof
The city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star-filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down.
> examine tower
Judging from the masonry the tower must be centuries old. It towers high above the nightmarish city below.
> examine iron railing
The most spectacular thing about the railing is the small statues decorating it. The artist must have used his most morbid fantasies for inspiration when carving these monsters, yet they are realistic to minute detail.
> examine statue
You can't see any such thing.
> examine first statue
You can't see any such thing.
> examine first morbid statue
You can't see any such thing.
> move closer to statue
You can't see any such thing.

> go west
Unless you learn to fly, the only exit is down the staircase
> go down
The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.

Study
Dust and spider webs cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam, blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic, dreamy forms. The walls are lined with bookshelves and a lone desk lies at one corner. Close to a staircase, which leads further up and down the tower, is a massive table made of black stone. A doorway leads to a smaller room to the south.

On the desk is a yellow paper.
