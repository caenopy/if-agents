No, not a prison, though stone stands around you, as expressionless as a mirror awaiting face and form; and in the silence you hear no plaint of flute or roar of gong, but instead the crash of porcelain shattering.

Moonlit Chamber
Moonlight diffuses through the walls, tracing out unreadable sigils in calligraphies of light and dark. Stairs adorned with bas-relief motifs spiral downward.

You can see a porcelain mask here.
> Examine mask
The half-mask is the pale, almost bluish color of the finest celadon, cracked with uncanny precision down its axis of symmetry. The face in its blank, sculpted features has no more personality than new-forged steel. Half a mask, though--that must mean the left half is--
> examine mask closely
I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the porcelain mask.
> examine mask closely for markings
I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the porcelain mask.
> examine surroundings
You can't see any such thing.
> go up
You are no magician to soar like the summer crane or the autumn hawk, and in any case, the blue-painted rafters arch above you to a remote and unassailable peak.
> go down
Shadow Armory
Shadows gather around you. For a moment, dregs of light defined by the negative space take on the shapes of maple leaf, kite, comb, and other shapes that flicker across the walls too rapidly for you to interpret.

Curiously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas-reliefs spiral upward.

Northward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen.
> go north
The shapes of light you saw as you entered fade irrevocably.


Undying Garden
Barren branches and pines suggest winter's quiet. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.

A jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, between translucence and opacity, curve and line, and other dichotomies too subtle for your eye. A gentle warmth from the surface invites touch.

Transactions of light show other rooms southward and westward.

You can see a tortoise-shell comb here.
> examine jade compass
The compass is carved from a single piece of jade in which violet and green intermingle delicately; the cardinal directions--if such they be--are marked by hawk, swallow, crane and feather. More curiously still, the needle is of glass, suggesting that it homes to something other than the north. Perhaps you can set it yourself?

The needle points to the feather.
> follow compass
That's not a verb I recognise.
> go west
Skeletal Banquet
It seems this is a banquet room, if a banquet had no especial place for people to dine. Glassware and stoneware are arranged in deliberate shapes, as though they are constellations. 

South lies a chamber of brooding silence, and a vague, sweet fragrance comes from the east. Stairs of blackest marble lead downward.

On the table are a banquet of bones and some ivory chopsticks.
> examine bones
The feast before you seems a mockery, for everywhere upon the plates and bowls there is nothing but skeletons artfully pieced together to create grotesqueries from ordinary game. A creature half-bird, half-rabbit, for one, or a pheasant with extra legs. Yet it is perhaps no more grotesque than some of the intrigues that poisoned the emperor's court, at times.
> examine ivory chopsticks
The chopsticks are pale, almost too slender for practical use, and perfectly matched, though one is carved with a dragon, the other with a phoenix.

The needle points to the feather.
> set compass to hawk
The needle points to the hawk now. You hear a clear chiming sound as the garden's trees and flowers move subtly, obedient to this new season.

You are no vine, to wear away stone through the patient vegetable work of twining stem and clinging root.

Undying Garden
Autumn's fiery colors are evident in the trees and flowers around you. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.

On the unliving trees is a folded maple leaf.

You can see a tortoise-shell comb here.
> examine folded maple leaf
This cleverly-folded leaf stirs as though, in its secret paper dreams, it yearns to fly.

I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the folded maple leaf.
