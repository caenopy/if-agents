You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Follow the following format.

Observation: a response provided by the game based on the previous action

Reflect: self-reflection on your progress and the effectiveness of recent moves

Memory: a memory fetched from previous experience and based the current situation
            
Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

CandidateActions: A short list (at least 1 but not more than 5) of valid candidate actions to take based on the last observation and thought, for example '[InteractiveFictionGame[go north], InteractiveFictionGame[go south]]'. Each action is a few words using only simple verbs and nouns present in the environment from previous observations formatted as 'InteractiveFictionGame[<action>]

Action: choose one of the valid actions provided in CandidateActions, or, when done, Finish[answer]

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
You awaken in your tent, lying on the floor, with a hangover like you wouldn't believe. As you lever yourself up, you notice that there is complete silence instead of the usual morning complaints of the workers and Roboff's usual shouting. This can only mean one thing - Roboff must have finally run off on you. Panicked, you look around and see your amulet lying on the floor. At least Roboff had the sense to not trigger off your alarm. Knowing him, he also had the sense to take the emergency radio. How the megakrip are you going to get out of this one?

In Your Tent
You are in your tent in the encampment. The tent appears to have been completely cleaned out. It is very hot in here and getting hotter. The tent flap to the south is open.
On the ground is the ancient jeweled amulet that you "borrowed" from Mr. Meshugge.

Memory: You woke up in your tent with a hangover and discovered that Roboff is missing along with the emergency radio, leaving you in a hot and empty tent with only an ancient jeweled amulet as a reminder of your past actions.

Thought: It seems like I am in a difficult situation, being abandoned by Roboff and left in a hot tent with no means of communication. I should try to find a way out of the tent and look for help. I will also keep an eye out for any useful items that I can use to my advantage.

Observation:
"Hi. Sorry about running off so suddenly but you know how it is... With luck, you will die, but I want you to have something to do while you starve so I'll tell you how to find the pyramid. Oh, I didn't mention that I found it two weeks ago? I never got in because the door is opened by putting that amulet of yours into a little slot. Anyway, go to the middle of camp and go east four times and north once. Dig there. Have fun!
   -F. Roboff"

Memory: "You woke up in your tent with a hangover and noticed that Roboff is missing along with the emergency radio. The tent has been cleaned out and it's getting hotter inside.

Thought: Based on the note left by Roboff, I should go to the middle of the camp and head east four times and north once to find the pyramid. I will also need to use the ancient jeweled amulet that I borrowed from Mr. Meshugge to open the door to the pyramid. Before I leave the tent, I will examine my surroundings one last time to make sure I don't miss anything important.
