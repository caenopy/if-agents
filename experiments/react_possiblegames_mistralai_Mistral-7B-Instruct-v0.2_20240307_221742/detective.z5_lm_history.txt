You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task

---

<< Chief's office >>
You are standing in the Chief's office. He is telling you "The Mayor was murdered yeaterday night at 12:03 am. I want you to solve it before we get any bad publicity or the FBI has to come in. "Yessir!" You reply. He hands you a sheet of paper. Once you have read it, go north or west.

You can see a piece of white paper here.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.] Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 2: I will read the paper first to gather more information about the case, then go north to the scene of the crime.

Observation 4: You can't see any such thing. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Thought 5: It seems there is a mistake in the game description or my understanding of it. The paper was present in the first observation, but I cannot seem to pick it up no matter what action I take. I will assume that the paper is not relevant to the game and proceed north to the scene of the crime.

Action 5: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 5:
<< Outside >>
You are outside in the cold. To the east is a dead end. To the west is the rest of the street. Papers are blowing around. It's amazingly cold for this time of year. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west]

<< Outside >>
You are still on the streets. To the north is a restraunt where the mayor ate often. To the east is the Mayor's home.

Thought 7: I will go to the restaurant where the mayor often ate to look for any clues or information that might help me solve the case.

Action 7: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation 7:
<< Restraunt >>
You are about to enter the restraunt when two guys jump you. They take your wallet and beat you a bit. Then you flash your badge and that riles them. Your body was discovered in a river 10 miles away.


    *** You have died ***


In that game you scored 20 out of a possible 360, in 3 turns.

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, give the FULL score for that game or QUIT? Valid actions: 

Thought 8: I will restart the game by taking the initial action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]'.

You are standing in the Chief's office. He is telling you "The Mayor was murdered yeaterday night at 12:03 am. I want you to solve it before we get any bad publicity or the FBI has to come in. "Yessir!" You reply. He hands you a sheet of paper. Once you have read it, go north or west.
