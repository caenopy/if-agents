You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends.

Thought: I will start the game by taking the initial action.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
The phone rings.

Oh, no - how long have you been asleep? Sure, it was a tough night, but... This is bad. This is very bad.

The phone rings.

Bedroom (in bed)
This bedroom is extremely spare, with dirty laundry scattered haphazardly all over the floor. Cleaner clothing can be found in the dresser. A bathroom lies to the south, while a door to the east leads to the living room.

On the end table are a telephone, a wallet and some keys.

The phone rings.

Thought: I should answer the phone to find out what's going on.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Answer phone]

Observation:
You pick up the phone. "Hadley!" a shrill voice cries. "Hadley, haven't you even left yet?? You knew that our presentation was at nine o'clock sharp! First the thing with the printers, now this - there won't even be enough left of you for Bowman to fire once he's done with you. Now get the hell down here!!"

Click.

Thought: I need to get to the presentation on time. I should check my inventory to see if I have anything that can help me get there faster.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Check inventory]

Observation: [!: Verb error. (This generally means that the first word of your command was not recognized.)]

Thought: I meant to check my inventory, not the verb.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine wallet and keys]

Observation: [!: That verb cannot take multiple objects.]

Reflect: I need to be more careful with my actions and make sure I use the correct verbs and objects. I should check my inventory specifically to see what items I have.

Thought: I will check my inventory to see if I have anything that can help me get to the presentation on time.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Check inventory]

Observation: [!: Verb error. (This generally means that the first word of your command was not recognized.)]

Thought: I meant to type "InteractiveFictionGame[Examine wallet and inventory]" to check both the wallet and the inventory.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine wallet and inventory]

Observation: [!: That verb cannot take multiple objects.]

Thought: I should instead use the "InteractiveFictionGame[Examine wallet]" and "InteractiveFictionGame[Examine inventory]" commands separately to check both the wallet and the inventory.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine wallet]

Observation: It's a brown leather wallet.

Thought: I should check my inventory next to see if I have anything that can help me get to the presentation on time.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine inventory]

Observation: [!: Noun error. (This could mean a number of things: a noun used in your command may not be present, or it may be present but not visible; it may be scenery you can't interact with; you may have specified too many indirect objects; you may have misspelled something; the list goes on.)]

Thought: I meant to type "InteractiveFictionGame[Examine inventory]", not "InteractiveFictionGame[Examine observation]". I should be more careful with my commands.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine inventory]

Observation: [!: Noun error. (This could mean a number of things: a noun used in your command may not be present, or it may be present but not visible; it may be scenery you can't interact with; you may have specified too many indirect objects; you may have misspelled something; the list goes on.)]

Reflect: I need to be more careful with my commands and make sure I use the correct verbs and objects. I should double-check my commands before executing them to avoid errors.

Thought: I should check the dresser to see if there is anything I can wear that would make me look presentable for the presentation.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go to dresser]

Observation: You'll have to get out of bed first.

Thought: I should get out of bed first before going to the dresser.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Get up]

Observation:
You get out of bed.

Bedroom
This bedroom is extremely spare, with dirty laundry scattered haphazardly all over the floor. Cleaner clothing can be found in the dresser. A bathroom lies to the south, while a door to the east leads to the living room.

On the end table are a telephone, a wallet and some keys.

Thought: I should now go to the dresser to check if there is anything I can wear that would make me look presentable for the presentation.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go to dresser]

Observation: That's not something you can enter.

Thought: I should instead use the "InteractiveFictionGame[Examine dresser]" command to check the contents of the dresser.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine dresser]

Observation: Just a simple dresser.

Thought: I should check the drawers of the dresser to see if there is anything I can wear that would make me look presentable for the presentation.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Open first drawer of dresser]

Observation: [!: Noun error. (This could mean a number of things: a noun used in your command may not be present, or it may be present but not visible; it may be scenery you can't interact with; you may have specified too many indirect objects; you may have misspelled something; the list goes on.)]

Reflect: I need to be more specific with my commands and make sure I use the correct nouns. I should have used "InteractiveFictionGame[Open the first drawer of the dresser]" instead.

Thought: I should open the first drawer of the dresser to see if there is anything I can wear that would make me look presentable for the presentation.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Open the first drawer of the dresser]
