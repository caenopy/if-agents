You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Detective
By Matt Barringer.
Ported by Stuart Moore.
Stuart_Moore@my-deja.com
Release 1 / Serial number 000715 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10 SD

<< Chief's office >>
You are standing in the Chief's office. He is telling you "The Mayor was murdered yeaterday night at 12:03 am. I want you to solve it before we get any bad publicity or the FBI has to come in. "Yessir!" You reply. He hands you a sheet of paper. Once you have read it, go north or west.

You can see a piece of white paper here.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

Thought: I will read the paper given by the chief to gather more information about the case.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Read paper]

Observation:
CONFIDENTIAL:
Detective was created by Matt Barringer.
He has worked hard on this so you better enjoy it.
I did have fun making it though. But I'd REALLY appreciate it if you were kind enough to send a postcard or... dare I even say it?... money... to:
Matt Barringer
325 Olive Ave
Piedmont
CA 94611
Just tell me if you like it or not.
If you want to talk to me over a BBS call the Ghostbuster Central BBS at (510)208-5657.
There is an Exile Games file area. Have fun. I WILL give hints out over the BBS to any of my games.

Thought: I will go north to continue investigating the crime scene.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation:
<< Outside >>
You are outside in the cold. To the east is a dead end. To the west is the rest of the street. Papers are blowing around. It's amazingly cold for this time of year.

Thought: I will check the surrounding area for any clues or evidence related to the crime scene.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Check surroundings]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: I will go west to explore the rest of the street and check for any clues or leads.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation:
<< Outside >>
You are still on the streets. To the north is a restraunt where the mayor ate often. To the east is the Mayor's home.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

Reflect: I have started the game by taking the initial action and reading the paper given by the chief to gather more information about the case. I have also explored the surrounding area but have not found any significant clues yet. I will continue investigating the crime scene by going west to explore the rest of the street and checking for any hidden clues or leads. It is important to remain thorough and methodical in my investigation to ensure that I do not miss any crucial details. I will also keep an open mind and consider all possible theories and hypotheses as I gather more information. Overall, my strategy is to explore the environment thoroughly, interact with objects and characters, and use logic and deduction to solve the case.

Thought: I will go west to explore the rest of the street and check for any hidden clues or leads.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation:
You can't go west from here!

<< Outside >>
You are still on the streets. To the north is a restraunt where the mayor ate often. To the east is the Mayor's home.

Thought: I must have made a mistake in my previous action. I will go north to the restaurant where the mayor often ate to look for any clues or information that could help me in my investigation.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation:
<< Restraunt >>
You are about to enter the restraunt when two guys jump you. They take your wallet and beat you a bit. Then you flash your badge and that riles them. Your body was discovered in a river 10 miles away.


    *** You have died ***


In that game you scored 20 out of a possible 360, in 5 turns.

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, give the FULL score for that game or QUIT?

Thought: I will restart the game to continue investigating the case and increase my score.

I have also learned that the mayor was murdered the previous night at 12:03 am, and I am to investigate the case before the FBI gets involved. I have been given permission to explore the environment and gather information to help solve the case.

I have started the game by taking the initial action of reading the paper given by the chief to gather more information about the case. I have also explored the surrounding area, specifically the area outside the chief's office, but have not found any significant clues or leads yet. I have made some mistakes in my actions and observations, such as trying to go north when it was not an option and checking my surroundings when there was nothing to see. I have also encountered a dead end when trying to go east. My strategy is to explore the environment thoroughly, interact with objects and characters, and use logic and deduction to solve the case. However, I have not been very successful so far in implementing this strategy effectively. I have made some mistakes in my actions and observations, which have prevented me from progressing in the game. I need to be more careful and focused in my actions and observations, and double-check my understanding of the game instructions and environment before taking any action. I will also try to explore all possible options and interact with any objects or characters I encounter to gather more information and progress in the game. In the next turn,

My strategy is to explore the environment thoroughly, interact with objects and characters, and use logic and deduction to solve the case. I will continue to be thorough and methodical in my investigation, and I will keep an open mind and consider all possible theories and hypotheses as I gather more information.
