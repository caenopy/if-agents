You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends.

Thought: I will start the game by taking the initial action.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
What was that?

You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.

"No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well-groomed egg, who confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind."

After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.

Rickety Fence
The ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other. Although it hasn't fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and if that egg isn't careful...

The footpath running along the fence veers sharply north.

The egg hums a little tune your mother used to sing at bedtime.

Thought: I should speak to the egg and try to understand why it needs help.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Talk to the egg]

Observation: To talk to the egg, try this: "egg, do something"

Thought: I should ask the egg what it needs help with specifically.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame['egg, what do you need help with?']

Observation: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

Thought: It seems I was addressing the egg incorrectly. I should use the correct form of address for the egg.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame['Egg, what do you need help with?']

Observation: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

Reflect: It seems that I need to use more specific language when addressing the egg. I should also consider the context of the situation and the egg's personality to determine the appropriate way to ask for help.

Thought: I should try a different approach to communicate with the egg.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame['Hello, Egg. May I ask what you need help with?']

Observation: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

Thought: It seems that the egg is unable or unwilling to respond to my attempts to communicate with it through text. I should consider trying a different approach, such as using a more conversational tone or trying to engage the egg in a more interactive way.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame['Hey there, Egg! What's up? Do you need some assistance with something?']

Observation: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

Thought: It seems that the egg is not responding to my text-based attempts to communicate with it. I should consider trying a more interactive approach, such as using voice recognition or trying to physically interact with the game if that is an option.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Say "Hello, Egg. May I help you?" out loud]

Observation: "Good day to you, too."

Thought: The egg seems to be in a grumpy mood. I should try to be more polite and patient in my interactions with it.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame['Good day to you, Egg. May I help you with something?']

Observation: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

Thought: It seems that the egg is not responding to my text-based or spoken attempts to communicate with it. I should consider trying a different approach, such as using a more descriptive or visual way to ask for help. For example, I could try drawing a picture or using emojis to represent my question.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame['👋 Egg, can you help me with something?']

Observation: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

Reflect: It seems that the egg is not responding to any of my attempts to communicate with it through text, speech, or visual means. I should consider exploring the area around the egg and looking for any clues or objects that might help me understand why it needs help and how I can assist it. I could also try using different keywords or phrases to see if the egg responds differently to them. Additionally, I should pay attention to any patterns or inconsistencies in the egg's behavior or dialogue, as they might provide valuable information or hints. Overall, I need to be persistent and creative in my approach to communicating with the egg and solving the puzzle it presents.

Thought: I should examine the area around the egg and look for any clues or objects that might help me understand why it needs help and how I can assist it.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the area around the egg]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: It seems that there is nothing notable in the immediate vicinity of the egg. I should try to explore further and look for any hidden objects or areas that might contain clues or information relevant to the egg's request for help.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Explore the area around the egg]

Observation: "I haven't the slightest idea what you're referring to," murmurs the egg.

Thought: It seems that the egg is still not providing any useful information about what it needs help with. I should try to gather more context or information that might help me understand its request. I could also try asking it more specific questions or providing it with options to choose from.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame['Egg, have you lost something?', 'Egg, is there a problem with the fence?', 'Egg, do you need me to do something for you?']

Observation: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

Thought: It seems that none of the options I provided resonated with the egg. I should try to think of more possibilities or ask more open-ended questions to give the egg a wider range of options to respond to.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame['Egg, is there something bothering you?', 'Egg, do you need me to perform a specific task for you?', 'Egg, is there a particular object or location you'd like me to find?']

Observation: You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

Thought: It seems that the egg is still not providing any clear indication of what it needs help with. I should consider exploring the area more thoroughly and looking for any hidden objects or clues that might provide more context or information. I could also try asking more open-ended questions or providing the egg with a larger range of options to choose from. Additionally, I should pay attention to any patterns or inconsistencies in the egg's behavior or dialogue, as they might provide valuable information or hints. Overall, I need to be persistent and creative in my approach to communicating with the egg and solving the puzzle it presents.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the fence more closely]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the rickety wooden fence.

Reflect: It seems that my previous actions were not clear enough, and I need to be more precise in my instructions to the game. I should also consider the context of the situation and the possibilities that the game presents to me. In this case, I should focus on examining the fence more closely to see if there are any hidden objects or clues that might help me understand why the egg needs help and how I can assist it. I should also pay attention to any details or patterns in the description of the fence and the surrounding area, as they might provide valuable information or hints. Overall, I need to be persistent and observant in my exploration of the game world and my interactions with the egg.

For example, I could look for cracks or holes in the fence that might reveal hidden objects or areas, or I could examine the texture or color of the fence for any unusual features. I could also try interacting with the fence in different ways, such as touching it or pushing on it, to see if anything happens. Overall, I need to be persistent and observant in my exploration of the game world and my interactions with the egg.
