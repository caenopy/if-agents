You awaken in your tent, lying on the floor, with a hangover like you wouldn't believe. As you lever yourself up, you notice that there is complete silence instead of the usual morning complaints of the workers and Roboff's usual shouting. This can only mean one thing - Roboff must have finally run off on you. Panicked, you look around and see your amulet lying on the floor. At least Roboff had the sense to not trigger off your alarm. Knowing him, he also had the sense to take the emergency radio. How the megakrip are you going to get out of this one?

In Your Tent
You are in your tent in the encampment. The tent appears to have been completely cleaned out. It is very hot in here and getting hotter. The tent flap to the south is open.
On the ground is the ancient jeweled amulet that you "borrowed" from Mr. Meshugge.
> Check inventory
You can't see any such thing.
> Go south
Center of Camp
This is the center of your camp. The entire place seems to be completely deserted. You can see Roboff's tent to the south and the storage tent west. East is open desert.
> Go south
Roboff's Tent
You are in Francisco Roboff's tent. The place is bare except for the emergency signal radio and Roboff's toilet in one corner. There is a note taped to the tent wall.

"Hi. Sorry about running off so suddenly but you know how it is... With luck, you will die, but I want you to have something to do while you starve so I'll tell you how to find the pyramid. Oh, I didn't mention that I found it two weeks ago? I never got in because the door is opened by putting that amulet of yours into a little slot. Anyway, go to the middle of camp and go east four times and north once. Dig there. Have fun!
   -F. Roboff"
