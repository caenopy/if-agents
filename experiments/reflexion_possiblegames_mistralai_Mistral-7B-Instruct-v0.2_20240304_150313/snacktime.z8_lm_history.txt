You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends.

Thought: I will start the game by taking the initial action.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
<RRROWWGRROWL> Your stomach growls.

You've been vegging out in front of that flickering screen for hours, your pet by your side. Now your complaining stomach sets you up on your feet, and on a mission.

Sitting Room
This is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food. That is a good room.

Even though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of "no"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.

Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.

Thought: I will go to the room with the food to satisfy my hunger.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go west]

Observation:
Food Room
Food room, glorious food room!

Your bowl for food and water is here, but that's only the beginning. There's also a lot of secret places where your pet keeps food and things that go with food and things that make food better. There's a thing that gets hot and a box that stays cold, and that is your favorite because you know there is always food inside there. A cloth hangs down from the door of the cold box.

Thought: I will check the cold box to see if there is any food inside.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Take the cloth and check the cold box]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: I will look around the room to find the cold box.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the room]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Reflect: I have been making progress in the game, starting by moving to the room with the food, but I was unable to find the cold box with food in it. I will need to continue exploring the room or check other areas to find food. My strategy so far has been to follow my hunger and explore areas that I believe may contain food. I will need to be more thorough in my searches and consider other possibilities, such as checking my inventory or asking for help from the game's characters.

Thought: I will check my inventory to see if I have any food or useful items.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Check inventory]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: I will explore the room further and look for any hidden areas or clues that may lead me to food. I will also consider examining the objects in the room more closely to see if they have any hidden functions or uses.

Reflect: I have been having difficulty communicating effectively with the game, as my instructions have not been clear enough for the game to understand my intentions. I will need to be more precise and specific in my instructions to ensure that the game responds correctly.
