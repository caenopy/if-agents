This has never been your favorite part of the city.  Nor is this neighborhood the safest one.  But as a city sanitarian, you are charged with completing an annual health and safety inspection of every restaurant in your district.

Each day you visit three or four restaurants.  During those visits you take note of potential health code violations in your trusty notepad.  Today's first target:  Nikolai's Bar and Grill.

A hazy sun barely peeks above the three-story tenements.

19th Street
You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street.  A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room.  The front entrance is north of you.

The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with broken bottles.  Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically.  A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak.

An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

A damp sheet of newspaper has blown up against the curb.

19th Street East
A street-front window looks into Nikolai's bar.  If you want into the bar, you'll have to go back to the restaurant entrance, which is west of here.  There are no cars on this end of 19th Street.  The sidewalk is uneven.  A curb-side storm gutter empties here into a grated storm drain.
> Examine storm drain
The openings in the storm drain are barely wide enough to insert three fingers.  You'll have to search more carefully to see what lies below.
> Use flashlight on storm drain
I didn't understand that sentence.

19th Street West
You are walking past the window to Goldschmidt's Pawnshop (on the north side of 19th Street).  Although the shop is closed right now, the window provides a neat display of hocked merchandise.  Nikolai's Bar and Grill is east.  To the west, the neighborhood becomes even seedier.

Goldschmidt's is closed for the day.  The door is locked.
> Go north

19th Street East
> Go north
A window is blocking your way.
> Examine window
The window is marked by dozens of greasy finger prints and years of accumulated scratch marks.  It should certainly be cleaned, if not replaced.  But you can still see through well enough.
> Look through window
Through the window you see the Bar.

A trapezoid of light falls on the cork dance floor.

Behind the bar is a dinky two basin sink with an attached faucet.  In the rinse basin is some ice.

A middle-aged woman, slight in build, is seated at the bar counter.  She has fallen fast asleep.

You also see a stereo.
> Try to enter bar quietly
That's not a verb I recognise.
