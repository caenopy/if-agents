You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends.

Thought: I will start the game by taking the initial action.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice.

Anyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new "Surfers Monthly" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening.

Shyeah, right. That's what YOU think.

Behind the Counter
You are behind the counter at "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor", where you are currently working. Not much of a job, but it keeps you from going broke during the nine months of the year when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing instructor. The rest of the parlor is southwest.

There is something pressing that you think you have to do, but you can't think what it might be.

Thought: I should check my inventory to see if there's anything important that I need to take care of before the end of my shift.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Check inventory]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: I should explore the area around the counter to see if there's anything out of the ordinary that might require my attention.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought: I meant to look around the area behind the counter to see if there's anything out of the ordinary that might require my attention.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around the counter]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Reflect: I need to be more clear with my actions and thoughts to effectively interact with the game. I should have specified "Look around the area behind the counter" in my initial thought and "Look around the counter" in my action. This would have avoided any confusion and ensured that the game correctly interprets my intended actions.

Thought: I should be more precise with my actions and thoughts to effectively interact with the game. I will now look around the area behind the counter to see if there's anything out of the ordinary that might require my attention.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around the area behind the counter]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought: I need to be more clear with my actions and thoughts to effectively interact with the game. I will now specifically look around the area behind the counter to see if there's anything out of the ordinary that might require my attention.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around the area behind the counter carefully]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought: I need to be more explicit with my actions and thoughts to effectively interact with the game. I will now carefully examine the area behind the counter to see if there's anything out of the ordinary that might require my attention.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the area behind the counter carefully]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: I should check the rest of the room to see if there's anything important that I might have overlooked.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around the room]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Thought: I need to be more clear with my actions and thoughts to effectively interact with the game. I will now carefully look around the room to see if there's anything important that I might have overlooked.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the room carefully]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Reflect: I have been trying different variations of actions and thoughts to effectively interact with the game, but I have not found anything out of the ordinary yet. I should consider my options carefully and plan my next steps based on the information given in the game description. Perhaps there is a clue or a hint that I have missed, or maybe there is a specific object or location that I need to focus on. I will continue to explore the area and examine any details that catch my attention, while keeping in mind the goal of finding something important that requires my attention before the end of my shift.

Thought: I should check the counter and the surrounding area for any clues or objects that might be relevant to my current situation.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the counter and surrounding area]

Observation: You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

Thought: I should examine the counter first, and then examine the surrounding area separately.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the counter]

Observation: It's a majorly boring counter which you're unfortunately very familiar with.  Hey, maybe that handwritten note lying next to a pizza box on the counter is related to whatever it is you're supposed to be doing now.

Thought: I should read the note to see if it provides any clues or instructions.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Read the note]

Observation:
The note reads:

"Stanley,
    Don't forget to make your delivery to Mr. Calzone, located at the San Doppleton Courthouse. You're already on thin ice, kid. One more screwup and you can expect to be looking for a new job."

The note is signed with the initials "RT". The paper is official "Mr. Tasty's" stationery with the name Bob "Tasty" Tasker and lots of balloons and smiley faces all over the border. Isn't that cute?

Thought: I should make the delivery to Mr. Calzone at the San Doppleton Courthouse as soon as possible to avoid any further consequences at my job.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go to the San Doppleton Courthouse]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: I need to be more specific with my actions. I will go to the San Doppleton Courthouse using the front entrance.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go to the San Doppleton Courthouse through the front entrance]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Reflect: I need to be more precise with my actions and thoughts. I will go to the San Doppleton Courthouse by leaving Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor and then going through the front entrance.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Leave Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor and go to the San Doppleton Courthouse through the front entrance]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: I need to check the directions more carefully to make sure I'm using the correct directions to reach the San Doppleton Courthouse. I will double-check the location of the courthouse and the directions to get there from the pizza parlor.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Check the location of the San Doppleton Courthouse and the directions to get there from Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Thought: I should consult the game description for the location of the San Doppleton Courthouse and the correct directions to get there from Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Consult the game description for the location of the San Doppleton Courthouse and the directions to get there from Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor]

Observation: You can't see any such thing.

Reflect: I have been trying various actions and thoughts to effectively interact with the game, but I have not been able to find the San Doppleton Courthouse yet. I should consult the game description more carefully to make sure I have the correct location and directions. I will also consider my options and plan my next steps based on the information given in the game description. Perhaps there is a clue or a hint that I have missed, or maybe there is a specific object or location that I need to focus on.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Leave Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor and go west on Elm Street until I reach the San Doppleton Courthouse]
