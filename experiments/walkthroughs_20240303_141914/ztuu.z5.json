The amalgamation of mutant rat-ants seems to have followed, mandibles clicking, saliva dripping, eyestalks focused only on you.\n\nThe rat-ants appear to be extremely agitated as they spy the huge crystals. One rushes forward, knocking you over in its enthusiasm, and tastes the crystalline boulders originally blocking your exit. The lead ant starts doing what could be called a dance of joy. The others form orderly rows, like chorus lines, and start moving in time to some unheard beat, no doubt led by the leader-ant.\n\nWith antennae gesticulating wildly, the leader ant quickly and easily lifts one of the boulders as if it were no more than a tiny grain of sugar. The others break their formation and one by one, take a boulder handed off by their leader and head for their homes.\n\nBefore you know it, they've made a hole large enough for you to make your escape from the tunnel!", "reward": 0, "moves": 84, "score": 90, "action": "sw"}, {"observation": "You manage to make your way through the remaining boulders, winding your way outward and upward to the land you left behind. Visions of tickertape parades, keys to cities, your picture on the front page of the newspaper, all swim in your head. And best of all, your name included in the honor roll of Adventurers. You can almost see the Grand Inquisitor welcoming you back with open arms, his reward in the forefront of your mind, as you, at last, come out into the light of day you feared you would never again see.\n\nAs you stretch and take in a big, healthy breath of fresh air, you hear the clicking and whirring of giant mandibles exiting from the opening behind you. You wheel around and point the can at the leader ant and spray for all you're worth (which at this point isn't much.) Still, you take out the leader ant, and the others, seeing his (or her) fate, run back to the safety of the tunnel. As you turn away from the tunnel, you are quickly surrounded by the Grand Inquisitor's guards. They seal the tunnel and then escort you to the Grand Inquisitor himself. His huge eyebrows arch upward as he glances at you, his eyes traveling up and down your frame.\n\n\"You seem somehow... changed,\" he booms. \"Have you grown?\"\n\n\"No...\" you say, noticing for the first time your more upright, less-cowering stance.\n\n\"Speak not unless spoken to!\" he interrupts. \"Now, tell me of the treasures which lie below, of the vast riches, of the wealth. Which gem or bauble did you find in greatest number?\"\n\n\"Well, there were a lot of grues,\" you say.\n\n\"Grues, indeed.\"  Shaking his enormous head, the Grand Inquisitor turns to his advisor, Wartle, and sighs. \"Yes, you were right, wise one. We should have sent Bilbonic the Plague.\" He turns back to you. \"Still, you managed to explore and return safely.
