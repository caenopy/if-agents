You are a student at Anycollege, in Anytown, and it's the end of the semester!  You've been slacking off all semester long, and it's catching up to you. That final paper is due for your Computer Science class ("The History of IF Games"), and you desperately need to check out a comprehensive book on Graham Nelson, one of the foremost authors of the obscure genre of interactive-fiction. You know there is exactly one such book, but you have no idea where it might be! 

The first time player should probably type "help".

Lobby
This is the entrance to the library. The circulation desk dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of desks and tables. A pair of security gates stands before the front doors to prevent people from stealing books. A card catalog lurks in a dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh flourescent light. Glass doors to the west lead to the book stacks; an archway to the northwest is labelled "Duplicating Services"; a door to the north bears a sign marked "Private" in large friendly letters; and the exit is to the east

You can see a circulation desk attendant here.
> X security gates
The gates are made of gunmetal-grey plastic, and a set of little red lights on top seem to watch you menacingly.
> X attendant
He's leafing through a dog-eared copy of Tom Clancy's "Without Remorse", looking terminally bored. He is wearing a nametag.
> Read tag
"Hi, I'm Alan."
> Ask Alan about novel
He glances up at you. "Yeah, it gets pretty dull around here on Friday afternoons, and I've already read this one six times."  He sighs heavily. "If only I hadn't lost that copy of "Debt of Honor" in the stacks. I've only read that one four times, and not within the past three months."  Dejected, he goes back to flipping the pages.
> Ask him about Nelson
"Try talking to the reference librarian."
> Ask him about librarian
"Try going through those doors, she's probably at her desk."

You push the glass doors open. Their hydraulics hiss faintly.

Ground Floor Stacks
This cavernous room is lit with flickering flourescent lighting which makes the ceiling look even lower than it really is. It is filled with half-empty shelves, upon which rest the dusty boxes of many early games. To one side sits a massive, ancient desk, its surface cluttered with paperwork. A sign on the wall indicates that this is the reference desk, which would make the prim young woman sitting behind it the reference librarian. A doorway to the north is labelled "Stairs", and glass doors lead east to the lobby.

You can see a reference librarian here.
> X librarian
She is an extremely proper young woman. She has her hands folded neatly in front of her on the desk, and a pencil so sharp it looks like it would make a decent stiletto is tucked behind one ear. She watches the room, and you, like a hungry hawk. Pinned to her jacket is a nametag.
> Read tag
"Hi!  I'm Marion."
> Ask Marion about Nelson
"Ah, that valuable book. We keep it locked away, in the Rare Books Room."
> Ask her about rare books
"The Rare Books Room is on the second floor. Stairs are north of here. You will need the key, though."
> Ask her about key
"The key may be obtained at the circulation desk."

(the ID card to the circulation desk attendant)
The circulation attendant gives you the key to the Rare Books Room, and he holds your ID card in exchange.

Ground Floor Stairwell
Grungy stairs lead upwards, to the second level. A damaged picture hangs on the wall. The door to the ground floor shelving area is to the south.
> X stairs
These grungy stairs lead upwards. Dust bunnies romp and play all over the place, and the dust sure seems thick. Maybe the cleaning staff is on vacation.
> Smell
There is a slight, fishy odor.
> Look under stairs
You found a red herring!

Second Floor Stairwell
Grungy stairs lead downwards. The lights are dim, and a painting hangs on the wall. A door to the south appears to open into a room of shelves.
> X painting
This painting could pass for a black canvas. The small plaque below it has "Grue" engraved.
> Give fish to grue
It almost appears as if an indescribable blackness forms in the painting and reaches out, taking the herring. It is followed by a terrible gnawing noise, and then all is silent again.

Second Floor Stacks
You are in a maze of twisty shelves, all alike.

(Well, okay, not really)

This cavernous room is filled with shelves as far as the eye can see. A doorway to the east is labelled "Computer Room", and the stairwell lies to the north.

A heavy wooden door bars the way to the rare books room. A sign indicates that the key may be obtained from the circulation desk.
> Search shelves
Tucked away in a corner, you find the novel "Debt of Honor", by Tom Clancy. Someone must've lost it!

Computer Lab
This entire room hums with the combined output of several dozen computers. All of them are hopelessly out of date, but at least they're still good for word processing.

A bank of printers on one side of the room frantically churns out paper.

You can see a technician here.
> X technician
This frazzled-looking man is thin and angular. He wears thick, slightly rose-tinted glasses, and exhibits nervous twitching. He is wearing a nametag.

He is leafing through a manual for security systems, and cursing the unreliability of the security gates.
> Ask technician about security gates
The technician throws his hands up in frustration, slams the manual shut, tucks it under one arm and heads for the stairs. The air behind him positively smokes from the stream of invective he's producing.

> X printouts
Wow, a complete copy of the "Encyclopedia Frobozzica"! You take it, as it might prove useful.

> X shelves
The games on these shelves range from every installment of the Zork series, through something simply marked as LTOI. There is a special shelf devoted to a game called, simply, "Curses", with labels like "R12", "R14", "R15", and "Curses95". Other shelves cover "Christminster", "Theatre", "Balances", and many, many others.

Off in one corner are several magazines dedicated to IF, including XYZZYNews and SPAG.
> X magazines
These IF magazines include XYZZYNews (named for an old magic word from "Colossal Caves") and SPAG, the Society for the Preservation of Adventure Games.
> Xyzzy
You invoke an ancient word of power, and a hollow voice whispers in your ear, "Quiet, please. No talking in the library."

The circulation attendant puts the key away, then he returns your ID card.

The circulation attendant gets a big smile on his face. "I wondered where that had gotten off to!"  He immediately becomes immersed in the novel.

He has opened up one of the security gates and is tinkering with its innards, muttering bitterly to himself all the while.

End Game


You succeed in gaining the biography, and you exit the library. The paper is written over the week-end, you return the book on Monday (of course), and you pass the class with flying colors (despite slacking off for the whole semester), and you graduate from college. 

Shortly thereafter, you meet an investor who loves IF, and you write a wildly successful game, get rich off of it, and live the rest of your life thanking all the IF authors of the past.

    *** You have won ***


In that game you scored 30 out of a possible 30, in 52 turns.
