This has never been your favorite part of the city.  Nor is this neighborhood the safest one.  But as a city sanitarian, you are charged with completing an annual health and safety inspection of every restaurant in your district.

Each day you visit three or four restaurants.  During those visits you take note of potential health code violations in your trusty notepad.  Today's first target:  Nikolai's Bar and Grill.

A hazy sun barely peeks above the three-story tenements.

19th Street
You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street.  A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room.  The front entrance is north of you.

The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with broken bottles.  Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically.  A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak.

An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

A damp sheet of newspaper has blown up against the curb.

You read: "Sofia Kozyar, a dancer at Hannibal's Exotic Revue, disappeared early Friday morning after leaving her place of employment.  Ms Kozyar immigrated to the US from the Ukraine on a student visa seven years ago, then remained in this country illegally after completing her Bachelor's degree in the fine arts.  Police have no leads in this investigation."

19th Street East
A street-front window looks into Nikolai's bar.  If you want into the bar, you'll have to go back to the restaurant entrance, which is west of here.  There are no cars on this end of 19th Street.  The sidewalk is uneven.  A curb-side storm gutter empties here into a grated storm drain.

A trapezoid of light falls on the cork dance floor.

Behind the bar is a dinky two basin sink with an attached faucet.  In the rinse basin is some ice.

A middle-aged woman, slight in build, is seated at the bar counter.  She has fallen fast asleep.

Dining Room
The restaurant area of Nikolai's is relatively small:  no more than a dozen four top tables, many still littered with yesterday's crumbs.  A larger bar area--the primary source of revenue here--lies to the east.  A rickety staircase leads to small balcony outside Nikolai's office loft.  A wide mirror is mounted on the wall high above, right near his office entrance.

On the south end of the room, a long window provides an unattractive view of the street.  The galley kitchen is north of here.

An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

Angela is gaunt and anemic.  She struggles to remain alert.

An obese man (Nikolai, the owner?) watches you from the balcony.

"Who's there?  Tell him we're closed" Nikolai growls in disgust.

Angela cowers, "I think he's the man from the health department."  She looks at you "We're not open right now."

Nikolai growls again, "We were just inspected six months ago.  Tell him to go away."  Without waiting for an answer from either you or Angela, Nikolai turns back into his office and closes the door.

Angela shrugs helplessly, and begins cleaning the dining room.

[Nikolai's sanitation rating has dropped three points.]
> x tables
The tables are four tops.  None of twelve tables have been cleaned since last night.

Angela begins wiping tables.

Angela says, "You mustn't take Nikolai too seriously.  He's really a very good man.  It's just... he acts kind of grumpy sometimes because of his affliction.

You write, "Dining room tables require cleaning." in the notebook.

Bar
Sunlight from the 19th Street window (south) casts an bright trapezoid across the cork dance floor.  In every other corner, the brick walls of this unpretentious watering hole are marked by shadows.  If you don't mind risking ptomaine poisoning, Nikolai's dining room is to the west.  Otherwise, the unisex lavatory is north through a low ceiling tunnel.

A set of Naugahyde stools are pushed against the linoleum bar.

Behind the bar is a dinky two basin sink with an attached faucet.  In the rinse basin is some ice.

Beside the sink is a personal stereo (held together largely with duct tape).

While sifting through the ice in the rinse basin, you pause in horror.  Buried near the drain is a severed human hand.

Lavatory
The low ceiling restroom is painted yellow, the color of urine and bile.  Its only fixtures are a porcelain toilet, hand sink, soap dispenser and automatic hand dryer, all mounted low to the floor as if they were reclaimed from an abandoned grade school, or this lavatory was designed for alcoholic ten-year-olds.

A Jackson Pollack pattern of vomit is splashed across the back wall of the bathroom, certainly nowhere near the toilet where it was presumably aimed.

Galley Kitchen
You are in a galley kitchen about eight feet long, and just wide enough for one person to turn around.  On the south side facing the dining room is a wooden prep table.  On the left end of the prep table is a mini fridge, and on the right end is a steam table.

Opposite the prep table is a flat grill.  Dried rivulets of grease ooze down the wall from the overhead vents.  A narrow aisle winds north into darkness.

Refrigerator
Nikolai's walk-in refrigerator is kept at a few degrees above zero Celsius.  The tight dimensions of this poorly lit unit induce a sense of claustrophobia.  The textured metal walls are splashed with now dry remnants of long ago dinner specials.  The exit back to the winding hall is east.

A five gallon soup cauldron is pushed carelessly into one corner.

A four tier wire shelf supports an assortment of hotel pans in varied sizes and depths.

Dish Room
On entering the dish room you are overwhelmed by the astringent smell of fresh bleach.  You would welcome this as evidence of sanitation, except that in such high concentrations bleach is actually toxic.  Already you're feeling a little nauseous.  A hall winds south into the darkness.

A manhole-size drain cover is set in the floor.

A warped wooden door is set into the cement north wall. The door is sealed tight.

The largest fixture in this location is a straight unit dish machine, with a stainless steel dish table on either side.

On the dish table is a dish rack (in which are some servingware).

You note a rat out of the corner of your eye.

An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

Angela is gaunt and anemic.  She struggles to remain alert.

Nikolai pokes his head out from the top office, "Angela, be a peach and pick up some bread from the food pantry." 

Angela looks puzzled "You mean the 5th Avenue Mission?" 

"Of course that's where I mean.  Our regular bread company won't deliver here anymore.  Just go to the food pantry and fill up your car." 

"I can't take food from a homeless shelter." 

Nikolai's face turns red, "We need bread, and you can get it free from the mission.  Tell them you're a homeless wench.  Tell them you've got twelve screaming brats to feed.  I don't care.  If you won't go there, then go to the store and pay for the bread with your own money, but don't come back without it!" 

Angela lowers her head.  She looks like she's about to cry. 

As Angela leaves the restaurant, you notice a small flashlight fall off of her key chain.

Winding Hall
A narrow hall twists and winds from the prep kitchen (south) to the dish room (north).  A walk-in refrigerator is west of here.  During every dinner shift, smoke from the kitchen drifts down this hall and deposits an oily film against the brown wall.

Mounted on the wall is a first aid kit.

A formidable buffalo chopper is parked against one corner of this twisting labyrinth. This machine probably harbors more than a hundred varieties of pathogens and therefore deserves quite careful attention.

Crypt
The edges and corners of this brown room are rounded by accumulated cobweb nets, making it look more like a small cave than an urban underground.  Moldy pylons and concrete extrusions resemble stalagmites.  Wet cardboard boxes stacked along the wall contain empty unrecycled liquor bottles.  The humid air smells of death.

You could escape through the drain pipe in the ceiling.

At the center of the room is a three foot by six foot sealed crate, composed mostly of particle board.
> open crate
Your first reflex is to gag.  Inside is the dismembered body of an adult female.  Her arms and legs have been removed, her abdomen sliced open and disemboweled.  Where her eyes were once, empty sockets remain.  Having been drained entirely of blood, her skin is now as pale as the clean cotton bed sheet draped across her pelvis.

She lifts her head, and knocks it three times against the bottom of the box.  But no, you must have imagined that.  She is dead.  Quite dead.

> x chopper
The chopper is old, covered in rust.  Drops of fresh blood leak out from the food trough in places where it has rusted completely through.  The device has an on/off button, and the rotating trough which is designed to carry large volumes of food past a stationary blade.  It isn't quite large enough to accommodate a full size buffalo.  But a rabbit or a small dog, perhaps.

The buffalo chopper is switched off.
> note it
For this to be a really thorough inspection, you'll need to open the chopper and examine the blade.
> x blade
The blade is hidden by a protective cover.
> open cover
The cover is held in place by a large screw.
> turn screw
The screw is rusted in place.  Your only other alternative for inspecting the blade is to reach in the trough.
> reach in chopper
You reach under the cover of the trough and cautiously poke around.  Wedged against the blade is a pulpy mass of sinewy entrails.  With some effort, you jerk the entrails free from the blade.

Suddenly, and without warning, the buffalo chopper roars to life.  Your sleeve catches against the rusty blade, which stalls momentarily, but seizes your arm deeper into the device.  Then the blade spins once again.  At first you're not even sure what has happened, but you hear a crunching noise, and feel faint from a sudden drop in blood pressure.  With a rush of endorphins, you yank your arm free from the buffalo chopper, and collapse on the floor.

You are missing a hand.  If you don't act quickly, you will die.

You fight against overwhelming pain to perform even the simplest actions.

Fighting against the most severe pain, you twist the tourniquet into place.  The flow of blood gradually ceases.

A moment later your right hand and the entrails which had been blocking the blade are ejected from the chopper at high velocity.  They land on the floor nearby.

Dining Room
An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

Since the last time you were here, Nikolai has managed to transport himself down those treacherous steps to the Dining Room.  He sits on one of those tiny dining room chairs, which appears barely capable of supporting his weight.  Angela has returned from her bread run.  She sits across Nikolai's lap, scarcely conscious, with just a trace of blood dribbling from twin teeth marks in her neck.  Nikolai looks up from her neck, with blood stains on his own fat face, "You're next, Mr. Health Inspector.  I knew you'd cause me trouble when you walked in here."

Since your last tour through the dining room, Nikolai has locked and barred the front door to prevent your escape.
> u
Nikolai pursues you up the stairs, huffing and wheezing from the effort.  You double your speed just in time to escape his reach.  Nikolai is left stranded and out of breath back on the fifth step.

Nikolai's Office
Nikolai's office is an ill-maintained balcony sky box above his restaurant.  A window looks out over the restaurant. But as you could see earlier, the dining room side is mirrored such that employees and guests can't see in.  A rickety set of steps leads back to the main floor.  The plaster walls are water stained and cracked.  A single unfrosted bulb hangs from the ceiling by a loose wire.  Mounds of unpaid invoices litter Nikolai's wooden desk.

On Nikolai's desk are a brass key and a book.

A plastic pitcher sits on the floor in the corner of the office, filled with some foamy amber liquid.

Your heart is racing.

You read: "Lore of the Vampires".  Two chapter titles catch your attention:  "Vampire Culture" and "Killing Vampires".  Most of the remaining chapters are written in an unfamiliar Slavic language.
> read killing
You read: Killing Vampires

Methods for warding or killing a vampire are so widely known, they are now almost cliché.  For warding:  either a wreath of garlic or a wooden cross worn around the neck should effectively ward off both the Bratislavan and Transylvanian type vampires.  For killing, only a weapon made of silver has any permanent effect.

Of course one is not likely to find these implements (garlic, crosses, or silver weapons) in the vampire's own abode.  This creates a problem for Bratislavan vampires who desire nothing so much as to kill and dominate their rivals.  They achieve this without the use of silver (which might be turned against them) by dismembering their opponents and scattering the remaining parts as widely as possible.  Yet even this gruesome ritual is impermanent.  The dismembered parts of a vampire retain their own force of will, and strive to reassemble themselves by whatever means available.
> read culture
You read: Vampire Culture.

Bratislavan vampires, like their Transylvanian cousins, require nightly aliquots of blood for their continued immortality.  But unlike the Transylvanians, who are mostly solitary in habit, the Bratislavan vampires fight actively amongst themselves for territory, a stable of victims and general dominance.  The most dominant vampire in a given territory is the arch-vampire.

Windowless brick walls rise three stories on either side of you, blocking out most of the sunlight.  The cobbled alley slopes down hill at a dangerous pitch.  You won't be able to get back to the street from here however, as the top of the alley ends in a dead end, and the bottom is securely gated, locked from the other side

A warped wooden door is set into the brick.  It leads south back to the dish room. The door is open.

A rectangular green dumpster is parked at the dead end.  Greasy effluent leaks from the sides and bottom, meandering downhill between the cobbles to form a slick but irregular path.

> put all in crate
severed right leg: Almost before you release it, the right leg wriggles snakelike into location below the woman's torso.  Muscle and sinew, then skin all regenerate between the disjointed limb and body.  The air crackles.  Your nose burns with the stench of cauterized flesh.

The woman flexes her right leg. She coos, "it still tingles.  But Sugar, you must still bring me my foot."

severed left leg: You hear a sudden crack, like bone breaking in reverse.  Skin and tissue then grow over the freshly attached left leg at stop-action speed.

The woman flexes her left leg. She coos, "it still tingles.  But Darling, you must still bring me my foot."

severed right arm: The right arm doesn't fit into its socket at quite the right angle.  Sofia grimaces as it twists into place.  The skin which grows over is purple and gangrenous.  But not a moment later the gangrenous stench has disipated and the skin color fades to a mottled bruise.

The woman flexes her right arm. She coos, "it still tingles.  But Honey, you must still bring me my hand."

severed left arm: Sofia looks with excitement as you lower the final limb into her coffin.  She leans toward you so that the left arm locks into exactly the right place.  The air crackles more loudly than before, filling the entire room with the smoke and stench of cauterization.

Sofia is saddened.  "That isn't the answer I had hoped for, but I shall respect your choice.

"You are a sharp fellow.  By now I expect you've figured out the situation on your own and I don't have to belabor my strained relationship with Nikolai.  We are both, to put it crudely, vampires.  When I moved into the neighborhood a few years ago, he still had the power to subordinate me.  But I knew he was being weakened by diabetes and it would not be long before I would inherit his territory.  Nikolai knew this as well.  So to prevent my challenge to his dominance he had me abducted and slaughtered."

Sofia smiles.  "Now, I suppose, is the time for my revenge."  She levitates out of this location to the dish room, then out of sight.

Nothing remains but fly-size specks of blood and tissue painted against walls and ceiling. You race to your car to vacate the neighborhood before police arrive.

You read in the newspaper the next day that police are unable to explain the carnage and gore they discovered at Nikolai's Bar and Grill that morning.  Police are still looking for the culprit.

As for you, you are just happy to have survived the gristly ordeal, even if it meant losing your hand.  At least you were able to rid the city of a coven of vampires.
