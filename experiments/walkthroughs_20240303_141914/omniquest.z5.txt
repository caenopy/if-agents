POP RULES!!

There's nothing to do, and you're sort of tired, so you lay on your bed and think philosophical thoughts.
(meaning of life, end of the world, etc.)  As you philosophize, you begin to doze...

You wake up with a horrible headache.  As you glance around, you realize that you are not in Kansas anymore.
You attempt to gain some bearing as to where you are...

The path here is a riverbed that has long since gone dry.  The river has cut several meandering passages into the canyon, forming what looks like two rather large boulders.  A passage to the north appears to go around the larger boulder, while a narrow gap to the southeast seems to go around the smaller boulder.  A passage to the east cuts the rock into its separate sections.  And of course, the passage to the west goes back the way you came.

You open the raincoat, revealing a match.
> give match to man
(first taking the match)
"Thank you!!" says the man.  He lights up for the first time
in 12 years.  "I have this fishing rod.  I'd use it, but I've
been sitting here so long that I can't get up.  Since you've
been so nice to me, you can have my rod."  He hands it to you,
and you take it.
> read scroll
The scroll reads:
Greetings.  If you have found this letter, you are obviously
trapped down here.  We, the Tamatis, need your help.  The
