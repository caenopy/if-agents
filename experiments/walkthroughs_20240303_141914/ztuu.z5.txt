It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you."

"What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly.

"Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages."

"And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully.

"A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever.

"But what of Kolchack the --"

"Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!"  He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!"

And with that, you embark on...

New Excavation
You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.
> ne
As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!

Tunnel
You are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.
> examine boulders
The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.

Cultural Complex
This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period."  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription "Convention Center."  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science."
> n

Convention Center Lobby
You are standing at the entrance of the GUE Convention Center. On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust. Although the whole cultural center appears to have been long-abandoned, loud, low-pitched sounds emanate from the door standing open to the north. And while these sounds most closely approximate those made by under-lubricated granola fabricators, they nonetheless fill you with dread. Next to the door is a sign, and to the sign's left (northwest to you) is a souvenir stand. The cultural center's lobby lies to the south.
> nw

Souvenir Stand
You find yourself standing in front of a souvenir stand that is clearly affiliated with the Convention Center. An odd-looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye-catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.

On the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi-Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.

You can see a salesman here.
> talk to man
Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.

Two things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask.
> take mask
With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face. In hellish harmony, two terrifying screams fill the air: yours, as the first human to see a grue; and his, as prelude to a graphic demonstration of why it is that they aren't seen by light of day (to wit: spontaneous grueish combustion, leaving only a greasy slick on the ground by your feet.) Although you will spend the rest of your life trying to forget what you have just seen, the sight of that sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed face and razor-like fingers remains forever etched in your mind. You throw the mask away in horror at what you've just seen.

[Your score has just gone up by eight points.]

Changing Room
It is obvious from the array of body suits, masks, and gloves heaped on the ground, that this is a changing room, and not a very comfortable one at that. No chairs, tables, hooks, hangers, or shelves here: just the costumes themselves, each piece more hideous than the last. A mirror hangs opposite the curtain through which you entered.

You can see eight pairs of gloves (a pair of hairy gloves, a pair of spiked gloves, a pair of bloody gloves, a pair of stumpy gloves, a pair of blistered gloves, a pair of scaly gloves, a pair of razor-like gloves and a pair of suction-cupped gloves), eight masks (a slimy mask, a pock-marked mask, a four-eyed mask, a decomposing mask, a fish-mouthed mask, a lizard-like mask, a fungus-like mask and a humanoid mask) and eight body suits (a gelatinous body suit, a feathered body suit, a glowing/fur-covered body suit, a rainbow-striped body suit, an armor-plated body suit, a sponge-like body suit, a blood-oozing body suit and a semi-transparent body suit) here.

You glide casually in, gurgling in loud, guttural tones; better still, the fish-mouthed mask is somehow providing a small amount of vision in the darkness. Two nearby grues ask if you are suffering from allergies (apparently, human dandruff levels are above normal for this time of year); another group debates among themselves whether you are a Borphee grue or an Antharian grue (their accents are similar, especially when pronouncing words ending in "gzk" and "kkgrk.")  Otherwise, your disguise appears to be working, though for how long is anybody's guess.

Convention Hall
You are in attendance at the annual Grue Convention, this year a rather somber affair due to the "adventurer famine" that has gripped gruedom in this isolated corner of the empire. Standing at a lectern on stage, a prominent grue is presenting a paper entitled, "Surviving the Lean Years: Is Lurking Enough?"  All around you, grues are standing; some in conversation, some drinking, some even paying attention to the speaker.

There is a trash chute in one of the walls, and a reader board hangs nearby.

You can see some grues, a hat, some clothes, some chewed-up shoes and a pair of glasses here.

Theater
This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.
> e

Stage
The rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.)  As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle.

Backstage
Ah... ah... choo! Those curtains! If I weren't so busy helping you with this game, I'd suggest you go on without me and let me clean this place up enough so that when you returned, I could at least describe it decently. I'll do the best I can, though. A thick, maroon curtain separates the backstage area from the stage. This area was obviously the target of a small, underground tornado (a Vorx) as scrims, scenery and costumes litter the floor. 

Even an old steamer trunk, virtually decaying from age, rests in a corner.
> open trunk
Phew! Now that's musty! The trunk, beside hiding an invisible dead elephant (what else could produce that smell?), holds a rare quint-Zorkmid coin.

Hall of Science Lobby
Compared to the grandeur of the other parts of the Cultural Center, the Hall of Science is rather austere, serving mainly as the entrance to three smallish rooms, at the openings to which stand small reader-boards. These say "MUSEUM OF ILLUSIONS!" (east), "SEE THE MUD FORUM!" (south), and "MUSEUM OF ADVENTURE!" (west). The larger area to the north is the Cultural Center.

The Mud Forum
This large, square chamber is certainly messy enough for a mud forum (whatever that might be), but there is no mud in sight (for purposes of argument, it could be postulated that the water source for the mud has dried up, or that mud was brought in for some scientific purpose, or that MUD refers to a Multi-User Dungeon of the sort now popular among the better-socialized members of the adventurer class.) In the southeast corner of the room a sign reading, "Exhibit Closed! Danger!" overlays another sign, beneath which is a sealed door. On the floor, starting near the center of the room, four large symbols have been painted in royal purple; a large display unit with a heavy wooden cover stands behind. 

Scattered willy-nilly around the floor are detailed replicas of a white house, an evergreen tree, a person with a flattened head, a raft, and a hot-air balloon.

You can see a tree, a house, a hot-air balloon, a flathead and a raft here.
> examine tree
The tree is a perfect miniature of the now-rare Subterraneous Vegitatus, a species thought to have existed only underground. Its leaves are individually painted, each one a miniature masterpiece. Sitting on the tree is a glass ball and a lone strand of tinsel.
> examine ball
It appears to be left over from some ancient decorative holiday. Painted on the inner surface of the ball is a scene of a young man, lying by the curb right by a sewer grate in the street. He's apparently been fishing for coins; he holds in his hands a piece of string, on the end of which is a piece of gum. Stuck to the gum is a shiny coin.
> take tinsel
Removed.
> examine coin
This is a coin, similar in shape and size to an old Chinese coin, complete with a square hole in its center. Stamped on its face is "5 Zorkmids."
> tie tinsel to coin
You carefully thread the tinsel through the coin's square opening, tying it in a knot. The coin now dangles from the tinsel.

Museum of Illusion
The Museum of Illusion was dedicated to the memory of the Great Implementers - figures who were believed to have created the GUE as an act of pure will. Before you, a row of delicately crafted porcelain busts of these immortal greats once stood. Legend has it that so lifelike were these busts, that they would seem to talk among themselves, discussing history, the arts, music, and philosophy, much as those mythic figures did in the Golden Age of Text Adventures. But years of neglect and the ravages of time have toppled most from atop their finely-wrought pedestals. Now, alas, the only two that remain are those of Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, bloodied, but unbent; battered, but unbroken; shaken, but not stirred.

Worse than the physical desecration of this shrine, it is clear that an attempt was made to commercialize what remains, for now, above the busts, is a sign reading, "Consult the Oracles - 10 Zorkmids."  Beneath the sign is a coin-sized slot. 

Mike's eyes, like those on a famous science-fiction adventure game box, seem to follow you as you approach. "Marc! Wake up! We have company!"
> put coin in slot
The coin drops into the slot, but (unbeknownst to Mike and Marc) remains tied to the tinsel. 

Marc looks with some satisfaction at Mike, then assumes a very serious (oracular, one might say) pose. A holographic image of an hourglass miraculously appears beside him, the number "10" glowing inside with a harsh, red light.  The number "10" is replaced by "9" as his voice drops three or four octaves. "Now hear the Oracle of the Implementers," he begins. (7) "The Wisdom of the Ages," he continues, in no apparent hurry. (5) "The Revealed Truth of All Truths," he drones, the word `truths' somehow adding an extra syllable or two. (2) And, finally, "Listen." Then, snapping out of his trance-like state, he looks in your direction rather sheepishly. "Sorry about that," he says. "I get a little carried away. Just another five Zorkmids and I'll finish up with a really juicy piece of information."  He looks at you expectantly.

Marc's bust does a double-take. "Hmm," he hmms. "Not a bad-looking specimen, though back in the old days, they built `em tougher."
> pull tinsel
Taken.

Mike's bust looks wistful. "Sigh," he sighs. "Oh for the olden, golden days of yore."
> put coin in slot
Mike seems surprised (and not altogether pleased) that you've been able to put the same quint-Zorkmid coin in twice. With a blink of his eye, the tinsel goes up in a ball of sparks and flame (pyrotechnics being a specialty with him) and the coin drops fully into the slot. 

Marc assumes the oracular position and intones: "Ahem. It may be uncommon knowledge, but, it should be clear to see that text is not a great three-D medium. You may be blue, but looking through rose colored glasses helps bring things into alignment."

Mike says, "True, Marc. All too true. As you know, I'd try to pry the sixth rib I saw."

Museum of Adventure
This museum is a sick, twisted, and pitiful homage to that special creature as near and dear to my heart as a parser, the Adventurer. There, in the center of the room, sits a display that sends a shiver up your spine: A skeleton. On the small pedestal beside it sits a plaque. The walls have been clawed, the wallpaper and exhibit signs shredded by what was probably an over-excited tourist group of grues. In what looks like the remnants of their enthusiastic visit, piles of bones lie on the floor, cracked open, fang-marks clearly evident on their glistening white surfaces. One sign on the wall by a door to the southwest remains, though.

The lantern dims a little.
> pry sixth rib with sword
Click. Whir. Zzzzip! (Well, as a parser, I could give you a huge hint that the door to the Janitor's Closet has just disappeared, but don't count on my help.)

Janitor's Closet
As you step through the doorway, you realize you've entered a room so vast, you can see the distant curvature of the Earth. On the distant, foggy horizon, the ceiling appears to meet the floor, blending in the mist. The only thing in this enormous, cavernous area are shelves, shelves and more shelves, all of them empty, dwindling into nothingness. This of course disproves the ancient belief that there's never enough closet space.

On the shelves is an aerosol can.

> push button
As you push the button, a light shines out from inside the display unit, revealing a transparent film, lit from below. At first, a blurred image appears. Then, after a few moments, an almost magical, three-dimensional scene comes into view: a man with a flattened head stands in the foreground, while directly behind him is a tree. Behind the tree you can clearly see a house, while behind the house, hovering off the ground, is a hot-air balloon. Oddly, the raft appears off to the side, as if not in the scene at all. After getting a good look, you drop the cover and release the button.

Time passes.

You appear to have a fan club. The amalgamation of mutant rat-ants seems to have followed, mandibles clicking, saliva dripping, eyestalks focused only on you.

The rat-ants appear to be extremely agitated as they spy the huge crystals. One rushes forward, knocking you over in its enthusiasm, and tastes the crystalline boulders originally blocking your exit. The lead ant starts doing what could be called a dance of joy. The others form orderly rows, like chorus lines, and start moving in time to some unheard beat, no doubt led by the leader-ant.

With antennae gesticulating wildly, the leader ant quickly and easily lifts one of the boulders as if it were no more than a tiny grain of sugar. The others break their formation and one by one, take a boulder handed off by their leader and head for their homes.

Before you know it, they've made a hole large enough for you to make your escape from the tunnel!
> sw
You manage to make your way through the remaining boulders, winding your way outward and upward to the land you left behind. Visions of tickertape parades, keys to cities, your picture on the front page of the newspaper, all swim in your head. And best of all, your name included in the honor roll of Adventurers. You can almost see the Grand Inquisitor welcoming you back with open arms, his reward in the forefront of your mind, as you, at last, come out into the light of day you feared you would never again see.

As you stretch and take in a big, healthy breath of fresh air, you hear the clicking and whirring of giant mandibles exiting from the opening behind you. You wheel around and point the can at the leader ant and spray for all you're worth (which at this point isn't much.) Still, you take out the leader ant, and the others, seeing his (or her) fate, run back to the safety of the tunnel. As you turn away from the tunnel, you are quickly surrounded by the Grand Inquisitor's guards. They seal the tunnel and then escort you to the Grand Inquisitor himself. His huge eyebrows arch upward as he glances at you, his eyes traveling up and down your frame.

"You seem somehow... changed," he booms. "Have you grown?"

"No..." you say, noticing for the first time your more upright, less-cowering stance.

"Speak not unless spoken to!" he interrupts. "Now, tell me of the treasures which lie below, of the vast riches, of the wealth. Which gem or bauble did you find in greatest number?"

"Well, there were a lot of grues," you say.

"Grues, indeed."  Shaking his enormous head, the Grand Inquisitor turns to his advisor, Wartle, and sighs. "Yes, you were right, wise one. We should have sent Bilbonic the Plague." He turns back to you. "Still, you managed to explore and return safely. As your reward, you may take the afternoon off."
