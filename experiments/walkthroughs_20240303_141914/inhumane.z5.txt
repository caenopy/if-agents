You awaken in your tent, lying on the floor, with a hangover like you wouldn't believe. As you lever yourself up, you notice that there is complete silence instead of the usual morning complaints of the workers and Roboff's usual shouting. This can only mean one thing - Roboff must have finally run off on you. Panicked, you look around and see your amulet lying on the floor. At least Roboff had the sense to not trigger off your alarm. Knowing him, he also had the sense to take the emergency radio. How the megakrip are you going to get out of this one?

First-time players should type "about".

In Your Tent
You are in your tent in the encampment. The tent appears to have been completely cleaned out. It is very hot in here and getting hotter. The tent flap to the south is open.
On the ground is the ancient jeweled amulet that you "borrowed" from Mr. Meshugge.

Center of Camp
This is the center of your camp. The entire place seems to be completely deserted. You can see Roboff's tent to the south and the storage tent west. East is open desert.
> w

Storage Tent
This is where the party kept all its supplies. However Roboff seems to have cleaned everything out that was of any use. Several arrows of Da-Glo paint on the wall attract your attention to the empty food and water chests.
Lying on the ground is a brass torch of the "self-igniting" type. The ignite button is on the handle.
There is a shovel lying here.

> dig
You begin digging. After about two hours you strike stone! You rapidly clear off a stone slab about 10 feet down from the surface.

Bottom of a Hole
You are at the bottom of the hole you just dug. The floor of the hole is a stone slab with a little slot in it. You can nearly smell the riches that must be buried beneath your feet!
> put amulet in slot
Ok. As it slips in, the stone slab moves aside, dumping you into a pit. You look up and see the amulet falling into a machine that wraps it, addresses it to F. Roboff, and takes off on jets.

In a Pit
This is a sandy pit with stone walls. You are not likely to be able to climb out. The only thing here is a note taped to the wall.
> x note
"Thanks for the amulet! It only took me a few days to make this little set-up. If you really want to get to the pyramid, retrace your steps back to camp after the pit caves in (which should happen soon) and open my toilet. You see, I really found the pyramid with a mass sensor when we moved in and I built my tent over it. The toilet conceals a secret passage down into the pyramid, which I have been looting for weeks. Most of the easy stuff is in my private safe in Miami by now, but I left you a few goodies. Including the gold coffin, which I never found. When you get tired of poking around you can use the emergency radio in my tent. It'll call a plane to pick you up. Have fun!
   -Roboff."

You hear a rumbling and look up as the sides of the pit collapse. You manage to stay on top, and you end up in the desert again.

Roboff's Tent
You are in Francisco Roboff's tent. The place is bare except for the emergency signal radio and Roboff's toilet in one corner. There is a note taped to the tent wall.

You have stooped to a new low by snooping around toilet bowls. However, when you raise the lid, you find a dark hole going down.
> d
You clamber into the toilet bowl and climb down through the roof of the buried pyramid. You drop to the floor.

Round Room
This room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass points.

Alcove at End of Corridor
At the south wall is a large stone block with three stone disks embedded on top. The disks appear to be slidable up and down. Above the disks is suspended a glass tube stretching from wall to wall.
There is a tiny pebble on the floor.
Sitting on the left disk is:
  a solid gold brick
Sitting on the right disk is:
  a solid silver cube

The weight of the various bricks and cubes you are holding overbalances a hidden pivot in the floor. You are dumped into a pit full of snakes.


    *** You have died ***


You are floating disembodied in absolute blackness. Time passes at a strange, relative rate. After an infinite/infinitesmal time, you sense a presence near you. A voice speaks, resounding in your head as in a hollow gourd...

"Ah! Another of those wimpy delvers come to steal my treasure. How boring. Most of it was taken by that other guy who had the sense to avoid the nastier traps... But I am getting pretty tired of guarding what's left. I don't suppose that you have any chance of thinking your way through my traps, of course. But I'll let you try, and I won't even vaporize you when you try to leave. In fact, I'll make you a deal. If you prove to me that you are an incompetent Harry Sullivan by getting yourself killed by every single one of my deathtraps, after getting as far towards solving it as possible, then I'll give up and let you take the coffin.

"That sound good? I thought so.

"And you thought that you had successfully beaten that trap, didn't you?

"You've only gotten killed by one trap. Not bad."

Round Room
This room is at the peak of the pyramid. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a tall stone obelisk that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass points.
There is a shovel lying here.

Corridor at Doorway
The hall goes east and west from here and there is a doorway to the north.
> e
Yuk! You have fallen into a pit full of gray sticky glue.

Glue Pit
You are in a deep pit up to your chin in sticky grayish glue. You can probably climb out using a rough set of handholds on the east wall. (Probably carved by a previous sucker.)
> e
You climb out of the pit, dripping goop. You are coated with glue.

Outside Door
The hall ends in a door to the east. To the west is that pit of glue.
The door is closed.
> open door
The door swings open. A cascade of fur pours out, completely covering you and sticking to the glue.
> e

Hall Full of Fur
You are wading through knee-deep piles of the fur that is stuck all over you. The door is to the west is jammed open by more of the stuff. The hall continues east.
The door is open. A cascade of fur spills through.
> e

Glass Hall
The walls of this east/west corridor are thick panes of glass over the normal stone blocks. So is the floor which makes it hard to walk on your furry feet.
> e

End of Glass Hall
The hall ends in another glass-covered wall. On this wall is an iron shelf bolted onto the glass. (Actually the bolts go through the glass into the stone wall.) 
Sitting on the shelf is:
  a beautiful silver necklace
> take necklace
If you hadn't noticed, you've been walking on glass with furry feet. This will produce a large static charge. The necklace is sitting on a metal shelf which is grounded into the stone wall. And silver conducts electricity...
> n

Landing
This is a landing on the stairway. You can go down to the north or up to the south. A passage leads east.
> n

Bottom of Shaft
You are at the bottom of a ladder that goes up a shaft from here. To the south is the stairway up.
On the floor is a small coin-bag made of leather. It appears to have something in it.
> u
You climb up the ladder to a hole at the top of the shaft.

Exercise-Wheel Room
This room is laid out like an exercise wheel for rats except that it is 40 ft. across. You can turn the wheel by walking north or south. Equally spaced around the rim are twelve coin-holders. Some have gold coins in them. The coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is at the bottom of the wheel. Below it is the shaft that you entered this room by.

The wheel rotates under your feet. You stay at the bottom, but the hole in the rim that you entered by has moved.

The coin-holder at your feet has a coin in it. The hole is slightly up the south side.

    *** You have died ***


You are back in the infinite blackness. Eventually the voice returns, senses you disgustedly, and speaks. "Don't you know how lab rats eventually end up?

"Three deathtraps have zocked you so far. You're beginning to seem rather dumb."

Door Near Blades
The north hall ends at a door. Stretched from wall to wall and floor to roof in the hall are long thin metal blades that you have to worm between very carefully.
The door is closed.

The door is apparently on a very weak spring. You open it, but it begins swinging shut the moment you release it.

Stalagmite Room
You are at the south end of a room. There is a door to the south. The floor is covered with hundreds of stalagmites.
The door is swinging closed.

The door has swung shut and locked behind you.
> n
In walking, you have bumped into and broken some stalagmites. They are hollow and water starts pouring out, slowly filling the room.

North Stalagmite Room
This is the north end of the stalagmite room. On the north wall is a button with something written on it. The only way out is back south.
> push button
(the labelled button)
Click. Fear gas sprays out of the walls, causing you to panic and run for the locked door. You break most of the stalagmites in the rush, so the water is up to your chest by the time you reach the door. When you hit it, you break through. The water washes you down the hall and through the blades.


    *** You have died ***


You are back in the infinite blackness. Eventually the voice returns, senses you disgustedly, and speaks. "Don't panic... Don't panic... Don't panic... It's not good for you...

Corridor Near Pit
West is a large round pit about 65 feet deep. Running down the center of the pit is an axle with a platform attached at the level of this hall. The platform is swinging around the wall of the pit. You see another hall west across the pit.

The platform is to the northwest of the axle.

Key Room
In the center of this room is a stone block. There is a stone disk on the top surface of the block. Directly above the disk is suspended a glass globe just full of spiders and little snakes and scorpions. Exits are north and south.
Sitting on the disk is:
  a iron key
> get key
The key is stuck to the disk with a dot of wax, which you pull it off of. Odd -- the key seems to have negative weight. With the lift of the key removed, the disk sinks a few inches. However, there is no other effect. You have actually survived a trap!

Demon Room
This room is full of carved demons and devils doing nasty thing to innocent people. There is quite a bit of gold-leaf fresco and bas-relief. Very nice if you don't mind the subject matter. The only exit is south.

    *** You have died ***


You are back in the infinite blackness. Eventually the voice returns, senses you disgustedly, and speaks. "Never go anywhere until you're sure of being able to get back.

"You've been killed by five deathtraps so far. You're getting pretty good at dying, aren't you?"

Round Room

Corridor at Alcoves
The corridor goes north to the stairs and south from here. There are alcoves to the east and west. In the floor between the alcoves is a quartz window.

West Alcove
This alcove has a stone platform set in the floor. The platform shifts a little but does not move when you step on it. Sticking out of the platform is an iron crank.

As the other platform moves down from the hole in the ceiling, you see a small robot standing on it. When it gets down to the floor, it looks at you, says "Ex-trrr-mnnn-ate", points an arm at you, and turns you into a small pile of monatomic dust.


    *** You have died ***


You are back in the infinite blackness. Eventually the voice returns, senses you disgustedly, and speaks. "Giving nasties a free ride down to where you are seems a little stupid.

Sitting on the floor in a clear space is a cut-crystal bowl.
The bowl contains:

You are back in the infinite blackness. Eventually the voice returns, senses you disgustedly, and speaks. "When standing inside a mass of uranium, it is not usually a good idea to drop a neutron.

A wide chasm crosses the passage at this point. Fortunately someone has built a wooden bridge across it. The narrow passage continues south past the bridge and north to the intersection.

Hmmm... The other rim seems to be made of a peculiar type of rock. Some type of talc or damp plaster. You slide back into the pit.
