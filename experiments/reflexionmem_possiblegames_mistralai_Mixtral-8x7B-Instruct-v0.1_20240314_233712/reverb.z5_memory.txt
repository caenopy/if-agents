The new memory is "handwritten note next to pizza box on counter."
"Handwritten note next to pizza box on counter: 'Stanley, don't forget to make your delivery to Mr. Calzone, located at the San Doppleton Courthouse. You're already on thin ice, kid. One more screwup and you can expect to be looking for a new job.' The note is signed with the initials 'RT' and is written on official 'Mr. Tasty's' stationery with the name Bob 'Tasty' Tasker and lots of balloons and smiley faces all over the border."
