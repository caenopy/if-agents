You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Follow the following format.

Observation: a response provided by the game based on the previous action

Reflect: self-reflection on your progress and the effectiveness of recent moves

Memory: a memory fetched from previous experience and based the current situation

Action: choose one of the valid actions provided in CandidateActions, or, when done, Finish[answer]

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.

Void
You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner.

Memory: The player is in a nightmarish alien world, trying to wake up from a nightmare where an old woman pushed them out of a window into this strange place.

Thought: It seems like I am in a dream-like world with surreal landscapes and objects. I will explore my surroundings and try to find a way to wake up or escape from this nightmare. I will also be cautious of any dangers or obstacles that I might encounter.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Memory: The player is trying to make sense of their alien surroundings and is desperately trying to wake up.

Thought: It seems like the game requires more specific commands. I will try to be more specific in my actions.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look at the hazy objects]

Observation:
They are sometimes stationary, sometimes moving around. Their movement is not linear and they seem to suddenly dissolve from one place, only to appear from nothing in a new place, apparently at random. Although they sometimes are close to you they always appear hazy.

A cascade of red colour explodes below you.

Memory: The player is in an alien world filled with hazy objects that are moving around in a haphazard manner, and the player sees a cascade of red color.

Thought: It seems like the hazy objects are somehow defying the laws of physics and appearing and disappearing at random. The cascade of red color might be a significant object or event, so I will investigate it further.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Examine the cascade of red color]

Observation:
All around you lighting and coloured clouds appear and disappear randomly.

Suddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long.

Reflect: It seems like there is a new element in the dream that is causing me fear. I will try to avoid looking directly at the shape and investigate it from a distance. I will also try to find a way to wake up or escape from this nightmare as soon as possible. Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look away from the shape]

Memory: The player is in an alien world, and a shape that instills fear has appeared.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look for an exit or a door to the north/south/east/west]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

Memory: The player is in a confusing alien world, trying to wake up.

Thought: It seems like the game is not responding to my commands to look for an exit or a door. I will try to move in different directions and see if that leads me to an exit or a door.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Go north]

Observation:
In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.

The shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.

Roof
The city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star-filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down.

Memory: The player is standing on the roof of a tower, which is built of crumbling masonry and has an iron railing of strange design. A winding staircase leads down from the roof.

Thought: It seems like I have been transported to the roof of a tower in an ancient city. I will explore this new location and look for any clues or objects that might help me escape or wake up from this nightmare. I will also be cautious of any dangers or obstacles that I might encounter.

Observation: That's not a verb I recognise.

Memory: The player has previously interacted with the environment using verbs such as "go" and "look."

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Search the roof for any clues or objects]

Observation: I only understood you as far as wanting to search the dark tower.

Reflect: It seems like the game is interpreting "roof" as "tower" in my previous command. I will try to be more specific in my actions and use the correct terminology.
