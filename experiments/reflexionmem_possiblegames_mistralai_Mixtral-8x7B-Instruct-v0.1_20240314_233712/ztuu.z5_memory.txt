You are at the entrance of a newfound area of the Great Underground Empire, holding a brass lantern and a plastic sword. The lantern's glow is dim and uneven.
You are trapped in a narrow tunnel with translucent boulders blocking the entrance. The only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens. The brass lantern's glow is dim and uneven.
The tunnel leads west.
The lantern has gone through a few cycles of impact revitalization and appears functional enough for the moment.
The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.
