Court Yard
A good sized courtyard with an air of late British colonialism about it.  To the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall with an ornate iron gate set into the rock.  The walls of a large stone mansion rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south.  In the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window.  On top of the west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of sticks, twigs, and leaves.

A carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net.  In one corner of the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light.  The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green.  Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone.

A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine.

The tennis ball launching machine sitting in one corner of the yard looks like a relic from the 1930s.
> Examine the stone mansion
I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the small water well.
> Examine the well
A very small well suffering from age.  It is probably meant primarily as decoration, however, for authenticity, it is also functional.  This is made obvious by the crank and length of rope mounted above it.
> Examine the oak tree
The tall, large oak tree casts long shadows in the evening light.  It's branches are decorated with small acorn nuts resembling little green Christmas tree ornaments.  The acorns are young and none of them have yet fallen from the tree.

> Examine the bucket
The old bucket is bent and dented and rust encrusted. It has obviously seen better days.  A number of small, roughly spherical holes decorate the marginally useful container.  It would seem that it has been used for target practice in the past.  In the bucket you see twenty-one tennis balls.
