You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

Follow the following format.

Observation: a response provided by the game based on the previous action

Reflect: self-reflection on your progress and the effectiveness of recent moves

Memory: a memory fetched from previous experience and based the current situation
            
Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: choose one of the valid actions provided in CandidateActions, or, when done, Finish[answer]

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
The Professor's map was just an ancient map -- as worthless as an ice cube in the Arctic without an instrument fine enough to accurately measure longitude and latitude. You knew that the site was nearby. You dug, and you ordered the workers to dig, even without the box. As you listen to the plane and rub your aching eyes, you pray they left you supplies enough to find the pyramid and to survive, and that the plane's carrying the long-overdue box.

Your Tent
(You are in the army cot.)
You are in your tent. Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little.
At the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.

Memory: A large, locked trunk is at the foot of the cot in the tent.

Thought: It seems like I am in a tent and there is a locked trunk at the foot of the cot. I don't have the key to open it yet, so I should explore the tent and see if there are any other items or clues that might be useful. I will also keep an eye out for the long-overdue box that the plane is carrying.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look around the tent]

Observation:

At the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent.

Memory: The tent contains a large, locked trunk at the foot of the cot and is illuminated by golden rays of sunlight filtering through the open tent flaps.

Thought: It seems like there are no new items or clues in the tent. The plane flying overhead might be carrying the long-overdue box, so I should try to find a way to communicate with the pilot or wait for the plane to land. I will also keep an eye on the trunk and try to find a way to open it.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Wait for the plane to land]

Observation: I don't know the word "land".

Memory: I don't know the meaning of some words.

Thought: It seems like the game doesn't recognize the command "Wait for the plane to land". I should try using a different phrasing or action. I can also try looking for a way to communicate with the pilot or find out more about the plane.

Memory: The game used the word "objects" in its response.

Thought: It seems like there are no objects in the tent that can help me identify the direction of the flap. I should try using a different approach to identify the direction of the flap. I can try looking at the sun's position or using the tent's features as reference points.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Look at the sun's position]

Observation: I don't know the word "sun's".

Memory: The sun's rays are filtering through the open tent flaps on the southern wall.
