The Professor's map was just an ancient map -- as worthless as an ice cube in the Arctic without an instrument fine enough to accurately measure longitude and latitude. You knew that the site was nearby. You dug, and you ordered the workers to dig, even without the box. As you listen to the plane and rub your aching eyes, you pray they left you supplies enough to find the pyramid and to survive, and that the plane's carrying the long-overdue box.

Your Tent
(You are in the army cot.)
You are in your tent. Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little.
At the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off cot], InteractiveFictionGame[look up flaps]
> look up flaps
You see canvas. What else?

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take off cot], InteractiveFictionGame[look up flaps]
> take off cot
You push yourself up and manage to get out of the cot. Your legs are a little wobbly, though, and your head swims.

You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[take in cot], InteractiveFictionGame[close cot]
> south
Outside Your Tent
You are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. To the south you can see a firepit and to the north is the entrance to your tent. Everything is oddly quiet, unsettling, creating a feeling of floating anxiety. The stillness seems to enhance the eerie quality of the desert, the feeling of being truly alone. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

You crane your neck and see a plane, high overhead, circling the encampment.

Fire Pit
You are in the center of the encampment, standing before a charred pit, a hole dug in the sand surrounded by blackened rocks. The night breezes have already started the reclamation work of the desert, covering most of the pit's bottom. You can see your tent to the north, the work tent to the south, and the supply tent to the west. Far off to the east, through the heat waves rising off the shifting sands, you can see gentle, rolling dunes. There's an enlarged hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.
Half covered with sand is a bright piece of foil which catches your eye.
Sitting by a rock is what looks like a matchbook.

Outside Work Tent
You are on an east/west path, directly to the north of the work tent. To the north you can see the firepit and, beyond that, your tent. The work tent borders an endless vista of fine, burning sand stretching out to the south. There's an enlarged hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

The plane seems to be circling right overhead. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[northwest], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast], InteractiveFictionGame[northeast]

Work Tent
You are in a tent which used to house the workers and their personal effects. Looking around, taking in the stripped and bare surroundings, you feel surprised that they even left the canvas walls. You quickly realize that they took what they needed -- taking everything would have been more trouble than it was worth. From the looks of things they cleared out quickly but quietly.
Tacked up to the inside of one of the tent flaps is a note.
Sitting in the sand, bulging a little, is a beaten-up knapsack.

It sounds as if the plane is flying off. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[take note], InteractiveFictionGame[take knapsack], InteractiveFictionGame[take all], InteractiveFictionGame[open knapsack], InteractiveFictionGame[put note in knapsack]

The note reads:

Fi aman Allah! 
Hereafter you shall pursue your fool dream of the hidden pyramid and its riches alone. May the jackals feed well on your bones. We have left you what you need to get back, though we hope you do not. We put several things you treasure above life itself inside your trunk, locked with your precious padlock, but we could not bear to part with the key. Especially after what you said of our rites. We hope the drug we placed in your drink did you harm. If not, we are at least satisfied you slept especially soundly while we cleaned out the camp.

Farewell

Southern Path
You are at the west edge of an east/west path on the southern side of the encampment. Directly to the west is a heavy growth of thickets, making any attempt at western movement a painful and futile task. Through the thickets you can hear the sound of water running gently by. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[northeast]
> north
Outside Supply Tent
You're on a north/south path on the west edge of the encampment. Directly to the west is the supply tent, its flaps open, still in the hot, quiet air. To the east you can see the central firepit, a reminder of your being alone. A row of thickets, impossible to make any progress through even with a machete, grows along the western edge of the camp directly to the north and south of the tent. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[northeast], InteractiveFictionGame[southeast]
> west
Supply Tent
You are in a tent, very much like your own -- a tent which had originally contained the supplies for your expedition. You notice, however, that most of the items which were here just yesterday have vanished with your workers. The tent looks as if it's been cleaned out and, as your stomach growls, the empty tent ironically reminds you of a turkey carcass picked clean after a huge Thanksgiving meal. Through the open tent flaps to the east you can see the firepit. If only one of the workers had remained behind, you would make him pay.
Stuck in the sand, handle down, is a small pick axe.
Half buried in the sand, in the corner of the tent, is a shovel. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[take shovel], InteractiveFictionGame[take axe], InteractiveFictionGame[take all]

Northern Path
You are on an east/west path on the northern side of the encampment. To the east you can see the sites of previous excavations your workers had begun before they deserted you. Low, gentle sand dunes roll out of sight to the north, but your camp's eastern border has a path, heading off to the south, which starts here. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

Desert
You are in the broiling sands of the desert, a short distance from the camp. Off to the west you can just make out a slight discoloration in the sand, the start of an east/west path which borders the northern edge of the camp.

Desert
You are in the desert, almost out of sight of the encampment, your only link with civilization. You are just close enough to make out a tiny dot on the western horizon which could be one of the tents. The searing sand is making walking a difficult and painful experience, something alien to you. There's an enlarged hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

Desert
You are deep in desert, the encampment little more than a memory. You think for a moment, closing your eyes, trying to picture the coolness of the Nile, the comfort of your cot, and are overcome with doubts. When you open your eyes again you are greeted with the same nightmare: All around you, all you can see for mile after mile is sand and more sand. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts. A cool pool of water seems to dance in the heat waves just a mile away. You can almost hear Rankin and Craige arguing over the spoils.
You scowl at the sun, cursing its searing heat.

Desert
You are in the desert, a vast wasteland of sand and heat. You think you see a spaceship settling on the horizon and, as you strain your eyes through the wafting waves of heat, you see a man and a huge robot. You can almost hear them saying "Gort, Klaatu Barada Nikto."
