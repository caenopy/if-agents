Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron-hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.

Void
You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north]
> north
You move, or rather you come to a new place. The concept of body and movement seems different here.

Void
This new location is not much different from the one you came from. The shadows are still moving around at random through the abyss, reverberating with strange sounds and coloured light.

A cascade of red colour explodes below you. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Void
This new location is not much different from the one you came from. The shadows are still moving around at random through the abyss, reverberating with strange sounds and coloured light.

Suddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[examine shadow], InteractiveFictionGame[north]
> examine shadow
In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.

The shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.

Roof
The city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star-filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take railing], InteractiveFictionGame[down]
> take railing
The railing won't budge, but one of the statues breaks of in your hands. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[put statue down]

The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.

Study
Dust and spider webs cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam, blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic, dreamy forms. The walls are lined with bookshelves and a lone desk lies at one corner. Close to a staircase, which leads further up and down the tower, is a massive table made of black stone. A doorway leads to a smaller room to the south.

On the desk is a yellow paper. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take paper], InteractiveFictionGame[examine writing], InteractiveFictionGame[down], InteractiveFictionGame[south], InteractiveFictionGame[examine table], InteractiveFictionGame[up]

Storage
This is a minor storage chamber, connected to the study through a doorway in the northern wall. There are some shelves, mostly vacant, here.

On one of the shelves are four small vials, each neatly labelled and containing some green powder. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take vial], InteractiveFictionGame[take all off shelves], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Roof

You can see a hideous statue here. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take statue], InteractiveFictionGame[down]
> examine statue
In the stone the artist has carved a hideous monster. It is vaguely human-shaped, but the arms are too long, the skin is covered by scales, and the fangs are definitely out of place. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take statue], InteractiveFictionGame[down]
