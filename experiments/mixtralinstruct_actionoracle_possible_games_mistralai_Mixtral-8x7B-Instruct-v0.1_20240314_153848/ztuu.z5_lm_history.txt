You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

Reflect: self reflection on your progress and strategy taken thus far

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

---

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers. If I encounter any obstacles or challenges, I will use my reasoning skills to overcome them. If I die, I will use my previous experience to make a better choice and avoid the same mistake. I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[Start]

Observation:
It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you."

"What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly.

"Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages."

"And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully.

"A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever.

"But what of Kolchack the --"

"Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!"  He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!"

And with that, you embark on...

New Excavation
You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[take into tunnel], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems like I am starting a new game of Zork: The Undiscovered Underground. I am at the entrance of a narrow tunnel with a lantern and a plastic sword in my hands. The valid actions include taking the tunnel, turning off the lantern, putting down the lantern or sword, putting down all items, or throwing the lantern.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[take into tunnel]

Observation:
As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe-soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head -- when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!

Tunnel
You are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that I have entered the tunnel and the entrance has been blocked by giant, translucent boulders. I am now trapped and my only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens. I should be careful and observe my surroundings as I proceed.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation:
Cultural Complex
This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period."  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription "Convention Center."  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science." Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that I have emerged from the tunnel and entered a cultural complex, which appears to be the center of the Great Underground Empire's cultural center. The room is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period" and features leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes, and primitive statuary. There are several paths leading out of this room, including north to the Convention Center, east to the Royal Theater, south to the Hall of Science, and west to an unspecified location. I should explore these paths and gather more information about my surroundings.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation:
Theater
This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put other down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Reflect: Reflect: After the initial setback of getting trapped in the tunnel, I have managed to find my way to a large auditorium. I have been exploring the different paths and gathering information about my surroundings. I have also been cautious and avoided taking any unnecessary risks. I will continue to explore and gather information while avoiding any dangers.

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that I am in a large auditorium with 69,105 seats and a long aisle running from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. There are also narrow aisles arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style, which I should avoid. I should continue to explore and gather information while avoiding any dangers.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation:
Stage
The rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.)  As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[take curtain], InteractiveFictionGame[take bow], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[examine footlights], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that I am on the stage of the auditorium. The stage has a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. There is also rubble and debris blocking the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leading back down into the theater's main aisle. I should explore the stage and gather more information about my surroundings.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine footlights]

Observation: The footlights form a long row along the front edge of the stage. They each consist of a candle covered by a small, round lens. Oddly enough, the lenses are virtually all black, except for a red lens, a blue lens, a green lens and a yellow lens directly in the center of the stage (perhaps this is where a solo performer would stand.) Stranger still, the footlights are glowing!

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that the footlights on the stage are each consisting of a candle covered by a small, round lens. The lenses are virtually all black, except for a red, blue, green, and yellow lens in the center of the stage. The footlights are also glowing, which is strange. I should investigate the footlights further and see if I can find any clues or useful items.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[take yellow lens]

Observation: Yeow! That's hot! Need I add "sizzle"? Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[take curtain], InteractiveFictionGame[take bow], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[examine footlights], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that I tried to take the yellow lens from the footlight, but it was too hot and I got burned. I should be more careful and avoid taking any unnecessary risks. I should also continue to explore the stage and gather more information about my surroundings.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine maroon curtain]

Observation: You can't see any such thing. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[take curtain], InteractiveFictionGame[take bow], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[examine footlights], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that I cannot see the maroon curtain when I try to examine it. This could mean that the curtain is not actually there, or that it is hidden or obscured in some way. I should continue to explore the stage and gather more information about my surroundings. I should also be careful and avoid taking any unnecessary risks.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[west]

Observation: Theater Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[east], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put other down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern], InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Reflect: Reflect: After getting trapped in the tunnel and making my way to the auditorium, I have been exploring the different paths and gathering information about my surroundings. I have been cautious and avoided taking any unnecessary risks. However, I have also encountered some obstacles and challenges, such as the hot yellow lens on the footlights. I should continue to explore and gather information while avoiding any dangers and overcoming any obstacles that I encounter.

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that I have returned to the theater from the stage. I should continue to explore the theater and gather more information about my surroundings. I should also be careful and avoid taking any unnecessary risks. One option could be to go north and explore the Hall of Science.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[north]

Observation:
Seating Area
You are in an expansive area, surrounded by large, throne-like seats. Aisles lead in just about every direction.

Reflect: Reflect: After getting trapped in the tunnel and making my way to the auditorium, I have been exploring the different paths and gathering information about my surroundings. I have been cautious and avoided taking any unnecessary risks. However, I have also encountered some obstacles and challenges, such as the hot yellow lens on the footlights and the uncooperative directions. I should continue to explore and gather information while avoiding any dangers and overcoming any obstacles that I encounter. I should also be more careful and attentive when following directions and not make assumptions about the paths that I have already tried.

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that I have encountered some uncooperative directions and have been unable to go in the directions that I have tried. I should try to be more careful and attentive when following directions and not make assumptions about the paths that I have already tried. I could try going back to the stage and trying a different approach.

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that I am back at the Cultural Complex. I have already explored this area and have not found anything new. However, I have not yet tried going south. I should try going south and see where it leads.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation:
Hall of Science Lobby
Compared to the grandeur of the other parts of the Cultural Center, the Hall of Science is rather austere, serving mainly as the entrance to three smallish rooms, at the openings to which stand small reader-boards. These say "MUSEUM OF ILLUSIONS!" (east), "SEE THE MUD FORUM!" (south), and "MUSEUM OF ADVENTURE!" (west). The larger area to the north is the Cultural Center.

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that I have entered the Hall of Science Lobby. There are three smallish rooms that I can explore: the Museum of Illusions to the east, the Mud Forum to the south, and the Museum of Adventure to the west. The larger area to the north is the Cultural Center. I should explore these rooms and gather more information about my surroundings. I should also be careful and avoid taking any unnecessary risks. I could start by exploring the Museum of Illusions to the east.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[east]

Observation:
Museum of Illusion
The Museum of Illusion was dedicated to the memory of the Great Implementers - figures who were believed to have created the GUE as an act of pure will. Before you, a row of delicately crafted porcelain busts of these immortal greats once stood. Legend has it that so lifelike were these busts, that they would seem to talk among themselves, discussing history, the arts, music, and philosophy, much as those mythic figures did in the Golden Age of Text Adventures. But years of neglect and the ravages of time have toppled most from atop their finely-wrought pedestals. Now, alas, the only two that remain are those of Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, bloodied, but unbent; battered, but unbroken; shaken, but not stirred.

Worse than the physical desecration of this shrine, it is clear that an attempt was made to commercialize what remains, for now, above the busts, is a sign reading, "Consult the Oracles - 10 Zorkmids."  Beneath the sign is a coin-sized slot. 

Mike's eyes, like those on a famous science-fiction adventure game box, seem to follow you as you approach. "Marc! Wake up! We have company!"

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that I am in the Museum of Illusion, which was dedicated to the memory of the Great Implementers. The busts of Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn remain, but the rest have been toppled from their pedestals due to neglect and the ravages of time. There is also a sign above the busts that reads "Consult the Oracles - 10 Zorkmids" with a coin-sized slot beneath it. Mike's eyes seem to follow me as I approach. I should investigate the sign and the coin-sized slot, and see if I can find any clues or useful items. I should also be careful and avoid taking any unnecessary risks.

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that I cannot see the sign when I try to examine it. This could mean that the sign is not actually there, or that it is hidden or obscured in some way. I should try to examine the area around the busts more carefully and see if I can find the sign or the coin-sized slot. I should also be careful and avoid taking any unnecessary risks.

I could start by exploring the Mud Forum to the south.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[south]

Observation:
The Mud Forum
This large, square chamber is certainly messy enough for a mud forum (whatever that might be), but there is no mud in sight (for purposes of argument, it could be postulated that the water source for the mud has dried up, or that mud was brought in for some scientific purpose, or that MUD refers to a Multi-User Dungeon of the sort now popular among the better-socialized members of the adventurer class.) In the southeast corner of the room a sign reading, "Exhibit Closed! Danger!" overlays another sign, beneath which is a sealed door. On the floor, starting near the center of the room, four large symbols have been painted in royal purple; a large display unit with a heavy wooden cover stands behind. 

Scattered willy-nilly around the floor are detailed replicas of a white house, an evergreen tree, a person with a flattened head, a raft, and a hot-air balloon.

In the Mud Forum, I have found a sealed door with a sign reading "Exhibit Closed! Danger!" and another sign beneath it. There are also four large symbols painted in royal purple on the floor, and a display unit with a heavy wooden cover behind them. Scattered around the floor are detailed replicas of a white house, an evergreen tree, a person with a flattened head, a raft, and a hot-air balloon. I have tried to examine the sealed door and the symbols on the floor, but I have not found any clues or useful information. I should continue to explore and gather information while avoiding any dangers and overcoming any obstacles that I encounter. I could try to examine the replicas on the floor more closely and see if they provide any clues or useful items.

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that I have not found any clues or useful information by examining the sealed door and the symbols on the floor. I should continue to explore the Mud Forum and gather more information about my surroundings. I could try to examine the replicas on the floor more closely and see if they provide any clues or useful items. I should also be careful and avoid taking any unnecessary risks. I could start by examining the white house more closely.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine white house]

Observation: The house is a beautiful white colonial. Even in miniature, you can see the front door has been boarded. Sitting by the house, mounted on the same piece of cardboard, is a small mailbox. You are suddenly overcome with an odd feeling, like you've somehow experienced this before.

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that the white house is a beautiful colonial with a boarded front door and a small mailbox. I have an odd feeling, like I've experienced this before. This could mean that the white house is significant in some way, or that it is a clue to solving a puzzle or overcoming an obstacle. I should investigate the white house further and see if I can find any clues or useful items. I should also be careful and avoid taking any unnecessary risks. I could try to open the mailbox and see if there is anything inside.

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that the mailbox is a replica and cannot be opened. This could mean that the white house is not significant in this case, or that there is another way to open the mailbox or find a useful item. I should continue to explore the Mud Forum and gather more information about my surroundings. I could try to examine the other replicas on the floor more closely and see if they provide any clues or useful items. I should also be careful and avoid taking any unnecessary risks.

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine evergreen tree]

Action: InteractiveFictionGame[examine glass ball]

Observation: It appears to be left over from some ancient decorative holiday. Painted on the inner surface of the ball is a scene of a young man, lying by the curb right by a sewer grate in the street. He's apparently been fishing for coins; he holds in his hands a piece of string, on the end of which is a piece of gum. Stuck to the gum is a shiny coin.

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that I am in a large auditorium with 69,105 seats and a long aisle running from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. There are also narrow aisles arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style, which I should avoid. I am currently on the stage, which has a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. The footlights are glowing and each consist of a candle covered by a small, round lens. There are also four large symbols painted in royal purple on the floor and a display unit with a heavy wooden cover behind them. Scattered around the floor are detailed replicas of a white house, an evergreen tree, a person with a flattened head, a raft, and a hot-air balloon. I have found a glass ball on the evergreen tree, which has a scene of a young man fishing for coins painted on the inner surface. However, I have not been able to find the person with a flattened head or any other clues or useful items. I should continue to explore the stage and the auditorium, and gather more information about my surroundings. I should be careful and avoid taking any unnecessary risks.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that I cannot see the area around the symbols when I try to examine it. This could mean that the area is not actually there, or that it is hidden or obscured in some way. I should try to examine the stage and the auditorium more thoroughly and see if I can find any other clues or useful items. I should also be careful and avoid taking any unnecessary risks.

Thought: Based on the observation, it seems that "explore" is not a recognized verb in this context. I should try to use a different verb or action to continue my exploration of the stage and the auditorium. I could try to examine the room more carefully or look for any objects or features that I might have missed before. I should also be careful and avoid taking any unnecessary risks.

Thought: Based on the new observation, it seems that I am in a large auditorium with 69,105 seats and a long aisle running from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. There are also narrow aisles arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style, which I should avoid. I am currently on the stage, which has a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. The footlights are glowing and each consist of a candle covered by a small, round lens. There are also four large symbols painted in royal purple on the floor and a display unit with a heavy wooden cover behind them. Scattered around the floor are detailed replicas of a white house, an evergreen tree, a person with a flattened head, a raft, and a hot-air balloon. I have found a glass ball on the evergreen tree, which has a scene of a young man fishing for coins painted on the inner surface. However, I have not been able to find the person with a flattened head or any other clues or useful items. I should continue to explore the stage and the auditorium, and gather more information about my surroundings. I should be careful and avoid taking any unnecessary risks. I could try to examine the symbols on the floor more closely or look for any objects or features that I might have missed before. I could also try to find a way to open the sealed door or bypass it if necessary.

Reflect:[[ Reflect: After getting trapped in the tunnel and making my way to the auditorium, I have been exploring the different paths and gathering information about my surroundings. I have been cautious and avoided taking any unnecessary risks. However, I have also encountered some obstacles and challenges, such as the hot yellow lens on the footlights and the uncooperative directions. I have also learned to be more careful and attentive when following directions and not make assumptions about the paths that I have already tried. In the Museum of Illusion, I have found the busts of Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, but I have not been able to find the sign or the coin-sized slot that was mentioned. I should continue to explore and gather information while avoiding any dangers and overcoming any obstacles that I encounter. I have also found a glass ball on the evergreen tree in the Mud Forum, which has a scene of a young man fishing for coins painted on the inner surface. However, I have not been able to find the person with a flattened head or any other clues or useful items. I should continue to explore the Mud Forum and the other rooms in the Hall of Science and gather more information about my surroundings. I should be careful and avoid taking any unnecessary risks. I could try to examine the other rooms and the symbols on the floor more closely and see if they provide any clues or useful items. I could also try to find a way to open the sealed door or bypass it if necessary.
