There's nothing to do, and you're sort of tired, so you lay on your bed and think philosophical thoughts.

Canyon Path
The path here is a riverbed that has long since gone dry.  The river has cut several meandering passages into the canyon, forming what looks like two rather large boulders.  A passage to the north appears to go around the larger boulder, while a narrow gap to the southeast seems to go around the smaller boulder.  A passage to the east cuts the rock into its separate sections.  And of course, the passage to the west goes back the way you came. Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[north], InteractiveFictionGame[put snorkel down], InteractiveFictionGame[put on snorkel]
> north
Small Clearing
This clearing is apparently a brief widening of some ancient river.  There are various small passages winding around two large boulders.  These are to the north, south, and west.
