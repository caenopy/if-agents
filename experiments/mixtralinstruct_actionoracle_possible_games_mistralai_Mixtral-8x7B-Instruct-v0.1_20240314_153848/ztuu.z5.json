I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you.\"\n\n\"What of Linklaw the Lucky?\" you ask shyly.\n\n\"Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long-ago buried for countless ages.\"\n\n\"And Fretsham the Fortunate?\" you ask hopefully.\n\n\"A fatality!\" the Inquisitor booms. \"Here,\" he says with evaporating patience, \"take these and be of good cheer.\" He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever.\n\n\"But what of Kolchack the --\"\n\n\"Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!\"  He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. \"Me! I am the boss of you!

This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.

North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription \"Convention Center.\"  To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby.

The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the \"maze of twisty passages\" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.

Before you, a row of delicately crafted porcelain busts of these immortal greats once stood. Legend has it that so lifelike were these busts, that they would seem to talk among themselves, discussing history, the arts, music, and philosophy, much as those mythic figures did in the Golden Age of Text Adventures. But years of neglect and the ravages of time have toppled most from atop their finely-wrought pedestals. Now, alas, the only two that remain are those of Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, bloodied, but unbent; battered, but unbroken; shaken, but not stirred.\n\nWorse than the physical desecration of this shrine, it is clear that an attempt was made to commercialize what remains, for now, above the busts, is a sign reading, \"Consult the Oracles - 10 Zorkmids.\"  Beneath the sign is a coin-sized slot. \n\nMike's eyes, like those on a famous science-fiction adventure game box, seem to follow you as you approach. \"Marc! Wake up! We have company!\" Valid actions: InteractiveFictionGame[west], InteractiveFictionGame[turn lantern off], InteractiveFictionGame[put sword down], InteractiveFictionGame[put lantern down], InteractiveFictionGame[put all down], InteractiveFictionGame[throw lantern]",
