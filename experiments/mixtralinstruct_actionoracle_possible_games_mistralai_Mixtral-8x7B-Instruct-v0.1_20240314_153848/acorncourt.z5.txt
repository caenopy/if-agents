GREAT.  THEY'VE DONE IT TO ME AGAIN.  You think to yourself. THEY'VE STUCK ME IN ANOTHER ONE OF THEIR SILLY SCENARIOS.  You glance about with a look of irritation on your face.  WELL, I'LL SHOW THEM.  I'LL MAKE SHORT WORK OF THEIR STUPID LITTLE PUZZLE...

Court Yard
A good sized courtyard with an air of late British colonialism about it.  To the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall with an ornate iron gate set into the rock.  The walls of a large stone mansion rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south.  In the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window.  On top of the west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of sticks, twigs, and leaves.

A carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net.  In one corner of the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light.  The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green.  Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone.

A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine.

The tennis ball launching machine sitting in one corner of the yard looks like a relic from the 1930s.

The old bucket is bent and dented and rust encrusted. It has obviously seen better days.  A number of small, roughly spherical holes decorate the marginally useful container.  It would seem that it has been used for target practice in the past.  In the bucket you see twenty-one tennis balls.

The machine is old and incrusted with dirt, but it looks as if it might still work.
The device spitters to life in a noisy cacophony of pseudo-humorous mechanical sounds.  The launching spring begins to coil back into place.
The ball machine's spring mechanism twangs noisily, and uselessly given nothing to throw, then pulls slowly back into place in preparation for another launch.

The tennis ball launching machine is currently switched on.
The ball machine's spring mechanism twangs noisily, and uselessly given nothing to throw, then pulls slowly back into place in preparation for another launch.

The machine is old and incrusted with dirt, but it looks as if it might still work.
The device spitters to life in a noisy cacophony of pseudo-humorous mechanical sounds.  The launching spring begins to coil back into place.

> examine pail
The old bucket is bent and dented and rust encrusted. It has obviously seen better days.  A number of small, roughly spherical holes decorate the marginally useful container.  It would seem that it has been used for target practice in the past.  In the bucket you see twenty tennis balls.

> examine gate
A painfully detailed, ornate iron gate crafted to fit the European styling of the court yard.  The heavy, stout bars block your exit.  Upon closer inspection you find a small key hole in the border of the iron barrier.

> examine oak
The tall, large oak tree casts long shadows in the evening light.  It's branches are decorated with small acorn nuts resembling little green Christmas tree ornaments.  The acorns are young and none of them have yet fallen from the tree.

> examine well
A very small well suffering from age.  It is probably meant primarily as decoration, however, for authenticity, it is also functional.  This is made obvious by the crank and length of rope mounted above it.

The old, rusty tennis ball launching machine has an "ON/OFF" switch on one side.  The machine seems to be pointed at the well.  In the machine you see nothing.
