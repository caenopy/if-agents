You will be given `input` and you will respond with `score`.

To do this, you will interleave Thought, Action, and Observation steps.

Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be the following types:

(1) InteractiveFictionGame[a simple action consisting of a few words like 'go north', 'check inventory' or 'take the key'], which takes a step in a text-based interactive fiction game.
(2) Finish[score], which returns the final `score` and finishes the task
Additionally, every 5 steps you will be instructed to reflect on your progress and the strategy taken thus far.

---

Follow the following format.

Observation: observations based on previous action and a list of valid actions for the next action

Reflect: self reflection on your progress and strategy taken thus far

Thought: next steps to take based on last observation

Action: always either one of the valid actions provided in the observation or, when done, Finish[answer]

Input: You are playing an interactive fiction game. Begin the game with the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' and restart if the game ends. If you die use your experience to make a better choice.

Thought: I will start by taking the action 'InteractiveFictionGame[Start]' to begin the game. I will explore the game and its mechanics, and try to gather as much information as possible about my surroundings and objectives. I will also try to collect useful items and avoid any dangers.

I will also reflect on my progress every 5 steps and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Observation:
The phone rings.

Oh, no - how long have you been asleep? Sure, it was a tough night, but... This is bad. This is very bad.
